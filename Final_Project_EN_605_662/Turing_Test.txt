Can machines think? 
Illustrate with the question: Will You please tell me the length of his or her hair? 
What will happen when a machine takes the part of a man in the imitation game? Comment as a role-player. 
Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
Is this question a worthy one to investigate? 
Do you play chess? 
In a chess game, I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play? 
The imitation game may perhaps be criticized on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does? 
There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked, "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how often the right identification was given. 
Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game? 
in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of a woman (A) in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?" 
A theological question of soul. I should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls? 
It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He sees fit? 
What do you think of Picasso? 
The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this type, "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' to any question? 
Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory? 
In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better? 
Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas? 
It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule that one is to stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees a green one, but what if by some fault both appear together? One may perhaps decide that it is safest to stop.
