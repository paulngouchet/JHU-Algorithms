Can machines think?
Can machines be conscious?


Illustrate with the question: Will You please tell me the length of his or her hair?



What will happen when a machine takes the part of a man in the imitation game? Comment as a role-player.
What will happen when a man takes the part of a woman in the imitation game? Comment as a role-partner.


Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?



Is this question a worthy one to investigate?
Do you recognize my face?


Do you play chess?
Would you think I played chess?


In a chess game, I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
The next piece. Let me help you with that one. What should I find?


The imitation game may perhaps be criticized on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?
If you want to use computer vision, then you must know where you are hiding the computer. In other words, you want the machine to think you are hiding it. The AI is thinking you are hiding your computer. Now ask the AI what


There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked, "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how often the right identification was given.
Many new digital machines, and new kinds of games that can now be played with humans, are being developed as a means for the human to learn an intelligence and to explore and understand other things."


Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?



in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of a woman (A) in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"
I am not very familiar with programming, but I imagine C is programmed with a programming language similar to Java or Java 4 or Java 8.


A theological question of soul. I should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls?
A personal idea of this idea. When we are human beings, we may have certain experiences in our life. For example, some days we may talk to an AI (a computer with a computer vision) and then we talk to another computer.


It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He sees fit?
It is admitted that there are certain things or ideas that He cannot do such as creating one equal to two, but we should not judge His right as a living being because of that. As a human being, we should not judge His right for


What do you think of Picasso?
Who do you think you are?


The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this type, "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' to any question?
Consider the machine specified as follows.... Will this machine ever understand what is said under this sentence?


Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory?

In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better?
So is the Summer of Love with Summer, to whom are you talking?


Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?
Not exactly. Mr. Pickwick is not as smart as the other people in the room. He would have to look at something to the effect of "Hey, you haven't thought of that yet. Mr. Pickwick reminds me of Christmas


It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule that one is to stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees a green one, but what if by some fault both appear together? One may perhaps decide that it is safest to stop.
The same rule applies: one is to stop when one sees a red red light, a green one, and black cars.
