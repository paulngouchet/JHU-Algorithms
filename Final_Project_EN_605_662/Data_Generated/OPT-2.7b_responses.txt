Can machines think?
(smiles while looking up at the ceiling to the right)


Illustrate with the question: Will You please tell me the length of his or her hair?
Yes


What will happen when a machine takes the part of a man in the imitation game? Comment as a role-player.
What will happen when a machine takes the part of a man in the imitation game? Comment as a human.


Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
Why? The interrogator may be more careful in deciding whether he's talking to a man or woman.


Is this question a worthy one to investigate?
I’d have to say yes.


Do you play chess?
Why do you ask?


In a chess game, I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
In a chess game, I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have 8 at K6, no king, but 8 rooks and rooks plus pawns. It is your move.


The imitation game may perhaps be criticized on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?
This kind of question is called the Turing test. First of all, I'd be obliged if you would tell me what the game is. What is the game?


There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked, "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how often the right identification was given.
Yes, why not? What do I have to lose? I've decided that, since the game would give me some experience in interacting with people, and I would also like to understand more about what people think, even if they are non-


Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?
Yes. They'd be able to recognize that this isn't a conscious machine by virtue of what their algorithms showed. These exist as of the Turing test; they'll always be a form of machine, and they can be reasoned with based on an


in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of a woman (A) in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"
If C is not a machine, then it is equally true that A, or B, or both, or neither A nor B, can be replaced by any other member of A, B, or by some other suitable being."


A theological question of soul. I should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls?
[Laughs.]


It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He sees fit?
It is true that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but if He wished He could, so I disagree with the claim that He has no freedom.


What do you think of Picasso?
He was a terrible painter.


The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this type, "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' to any question?
Since we must also know that its input conditions are those of something-the-same, the answer to Question [X] is false.


Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory?
You know it’s not real. The more that you ask yourself that question, in the way you pose it, the less you believe that this machine is intelligent.


In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better?
A summer's day is a very long day that ends in the darkness of night.


Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?
He was a good man, and so were you.


It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule that one is to stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees a green one, but what if by some fault both appear together? One may perhaps decide that it is safest to stop.
If you are in traffic and a light changes, just stop immediately. If you have a green light but you want to cross an intersection that does not have a signal, look to see if the traffic is moving slowly, so you can be sure
