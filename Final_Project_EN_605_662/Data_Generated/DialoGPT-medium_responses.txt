Can machines think?
I don't think so.


Illustrate with the question: Will You please tell me the length of his or her hair?
I'm not sure, but I think it's a little longer than a hairline.


What will happen when a machine takes the part of a man in the imitation game? Comment as a role-player.
I'm not sure what you mean by that.


Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
I'm not sure, but I think it's more likely that the interrogator will be wrong than the player.


Is this question a worthy one to investigate?
I think it's a good question to ask.


Do you play chess?
I do not. I'm not a chess player.


In a chess game, I have K at my K1, and no other pieces. You have only K at K6 and R at R1. It is your move. What do you play?
I play a lot of chess, but I'm not really good at it. I'm a beginner.


The imitation game may perhaps be criticized on the ground that the odds are weighted too heavily against the machine. If the man were to try and pretend to be the machine he would clearly make a very poor showing. He would be given away at once by slowness and inaccuracy in arithmetic. May not machines carry out something which ought to be described as thinking but which is very different from what a man does?
I think you're right. I think the odds are too high that the machine would be able to do the job.


There are already a number of digital computers in working order, and it may be asked, "Why not try the experiment straight away? It would be easy to satisfy the conditions of the game. A number of interrogators could be used, and statistics compiled to show how often the right identification was given.
I'm not sure if I can do that, but I'll try.


Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?
I'm not sure, but I think the only one I know of is the one that was used in the movie.


in view of the universality property we see that either of these questions is equivalent to this, "Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C. Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of a woman (A) in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?"
I think you're on to something here.


A theological question of soul. I should find the argument more convincing if animals were classed with men, for there is a greater difference, to my mind, between the typical animate and the inanimate than there is between man and the other animals. The arbitrary character of the orthodox view becomes clearer if we consider how it might appear to a member of some other religious community. How do Christians regard the Moslem view that women have no souls?
I don't know, I'm not a Christian.


It is admitted that there are certain things that He cannot do such as making one equal to two, but should we not believe that He has freedom to confer a soul on an elephant if He sees fit?
I don't believe that.


What do you think of Picasso?
I think he's a great artist.


The questions that we know the machines must fail on are of this type, "Consider the machine specified as follows. . . . Will this machine ever answer 'Yes' to any question?
I think the machine is a machine.


Whenever one of these machines is asked the appropriate critical question, and gives a definite answer, we know that this answer must be wrong, and this gives us a certain feeling of superiority. Is this feeling illusory?
I'm not sure if you're being serious or not, but I'm going to go with yes.


In the first line of your sonnet which reads "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," would not "a spring day" do as well or better?
I think it's a good idea to use the word spring.


Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded you of Christmas?
I would say he reminded me of a young Mr. Pickwick.


It is not possible to produce a set of rules purporting to describe what a man should do in every conceivable set of circumstances. One might for instance have a rule that one is to stop when one sees a red traffic light, and to go if one sees a green one, but what if by some fault both appear together? One may perhaps decide that it is safest to stop.
I think you're on to something.
