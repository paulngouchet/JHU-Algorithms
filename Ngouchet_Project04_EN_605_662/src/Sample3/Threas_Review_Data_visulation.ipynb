            "Meh. Not the greatest experience on a Chromebook. Seems to be customized for phones only. Opens in a little screen that you can't expand or resize - for reasons that are a complete mystery to me. Judging from the fact that every other app I know of is resizeable, this seems like it was a conscious choice by the developers . Why you'd do something like this is beyond understanding and suggests a control freak approach. Not a great way to make a first impression.Pretty good for a first launch!! Its easy to use and self-explanatory and I'd say the algorithm is good as well. It has great *potential* but a few things need improvement: -the ability to use hashtags would make it easier to find topics and people you'd be interested in -an option for a following-only feed would be a major improvement (especially chronological order) -the ability to choose images from albums rather than recent photos -the ability to save photos to phoneFor a brand new app, it's very well optimized. However it's just missing quite a few features that apps like Twitter have. There is no way to have your timeline show threads from who you're following. It would also be nice to be able to switch accounts quickly like on Insta. I've also noticed that videos have a hard time playing audio sometimes. Overall, it's a decent first version that I hope will get more features as time goes on. I'll up my rating once the things I mentioned are addressed.Great app with a lot of potential! However, there is a lot that needs to be fixed. For example, the option to mute accounts is lagging/delayed. This feature is definitely needed at this stage, which is part of the next problem. Another issue I've noticed is the home page shows a lot of accounts I don't follow and have never heard of, and a lot of blue check accounts that I don't want to see. There is no way to filter them out to see the content I actually want, from people I follow.The app is good, but it needs a lot of functionality. For example, when searching a topic, you don't find anything related to that topic, meaning anything that comes to you is via your main page, which incase lowers a lot of outreach and possibility of finding content that relates to you. Hashtags could called Threads and make it easier to find topics and such. Needs lots of work. It can be a good app, but it feels rushed.Currently, it's very challenging to use. It's in dark mode and I want to change it to brighten it up. But apparently I can only change it through Instagram? Why? Dark mode needs to be improved. It's tough on the eyes and the UI is visually unbearable. Twitter nearly perfected the UI. I think it's a decent start but I can't use it for more than a couple of seconds even if I wanted to.I still don’t want to see content from people that I don’t specifically follow unless I explicitly search for it. And when I do search, I want to see an option for complete searches and not just user searches. This is a bare-bones poor clone of Twitter that seemingly is just getting some initial traction due to political bias. No thanks - fix it. Also, if you don’t provide a web desktop option to use the service, it’s a double whammy.Could be great if all pages loaded when you clicked on them. Sometimes they just don't. Posts usually don't load at all. And my biggest thing: if you follow someone on Threads, you automatically follow them on Instagram as well. Either they're two separate apps or they're not. I would really like to be able to have a different list of people I follow on each app.I'm liking the concept! There is room for improvement though. Everytime I try to attach a photo to a thread, the app crashes. I haven't been able to add a photo at all. I also can't seem to find a way to view a list of only the people I follow. There's always other folks mixed in the list. Finally, I can't seem to edit my posts. I make a lot of typos! I can edit my posts on Facebook and Insta but not here? Weird.Not bad! This is its first launch. There is still room for improvements... I would like to see a trending page, longer videos, and an edit button for any threads(posts) uploaded by the user. Improve the loading time. Add a pause button(and slow motion controls for videos). A quality selection on videos(1080p, 720p, 480p, etc).Over all, the UI of this app is good. Using it is easy and visually it is very clean. Unfortunately, it fails in the functionality department. My home feed is 99% random people and not the accounts I actually follow which defeats the purpose of following someone in the first place. I recommend having the home feed be just the posts from people I follow and a separate discover/search page that will show new accounts who post similar content to those I follow.Nice but crashed & can't access photo folders. It crashed twice today so far in the middle of browsing. Also, for some reason, when I click the file button to attach a photo, it doesn't let me browse individual folders in my gallery...it shows my whole gallery which is inconvenient. Everything else is pretty okay and I expect it to get even better. Although another issue Meta should fix is that it shouldn't delete your Instagram if you decide to delete Threads lol please undo that.Pointless in following anyone. The feed algo won't show you the content you actually follow and want to see. I find myself opening this app wanting to like it but quickly get annoyed by seeing randomness. It's like you're invited to a party all your friends are at. Then you get there and it's nothing but strangers all trying to have incoherent, disjointed conversations with you at the same time. It's more stressful and annoying than engaging.Not quite ready for prime time. Needs a feed specifically for accounts you follow. If you have more than one Instagram account, Threads doesn't allow easy switching between accounts without involving logging out/logging in/security confirmation. This shouldn't need to be repeated over and over. Also, it is concerning that the app is blocked in the EU due to privacy violations. Use at your own risk.Very frustrating experience. Feed it's full of users I don't follow and don't care for their content. Switching between my company and private accounts forces you to complete sign out and reverify. Picture upload quality is compressed, Twitter images are much sharper. I am hopeful for this app, but it should have never been released as a finished product in it's current state.I like the simplicity of this app but there's definitely some bugs that need to get worked out. After choosing to sync with IG accounts I follow I weeded through them but about 1/3 that I unfollowed reappeared. I've done this 3x, closing out app to refresh, it keeps happening. Also, home page is super slow to refresh and posting a thread or reply is very slow to publish & sometimes freezes. Also wish that when trying to post a pic/video that one's device folders would appear & not just Gallery.It needs a lot of work. It constantly crashes, to the point where I can barely use it. It isn't auto-following everyone I follow on insta. I can't search for terms, which lead me to a topic I'm interested in and the layout feels quite lacking. It needs some sort of visual flare: animations, pops of colour, page transitions, etc... just something to make it all feel pleasing and tie it into a great package.My first thoughts: Since there is no web version yet, it is very difficult when using it upright on a tablet. But I'm going to try it on a few phones today and I'm sure it will work fine. If the web version comes, it will really be more useful than I expected. The leaks of this app first appeared in April, which means it could only release stable later this year, but when they wanted to turn the troubles on Twitter into an opportunity, they released the app with many missing features.It's cool, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the \"Post\" button at the top of the posting menu. Also, there's a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but needs some polish. Also, kinda wish there was an option to make an account from scratch rather than import an Instagram account.It's great, but there's a lot of QoL that can be done. Like putting the \"Publish\" button at the top of the post menu. Also, there is a bug where when you mention someone, if you type two letters of their name before the suggestions appear, the app crashes. I think the app has potential, but it needs some polishing. Also, I wish there was an option to create an account from scratch instead of importing an Instagram account.I find the UI does not clearly separate the messages and particularly which messages are part of a conversation. I have also found the app gets stuck updating and randomly crashes. It would also be useful if when I block someone, they are also muted rather then having to select both. I have had to remove a lot of people and companies I don't want in my timeline.Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface.It's not bad so far. A handful of unsolicited requests, but they're easy to despatch of. Clean feel and just seems nice and neat around the edges. It's like a flowing conversation. As a moderate social media user, it does everything I need it to for the type of app it is. Some sound and freezing issues with some videos I have viewed, though I am sure they'll iron these things out over the next couple of monthsIt's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.Constant crashing when trying to upload most photos, although there doesn't seem to be a pattern of image size or resolution, which causes it to crash or simply fail to upload. I have, however, been able to upload images up to 44MP, 33MB successfully uploaded. Would like the option to clear the random rubbish from my feed without having to keep muting them!The app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 3 stars is just because of these bugs.I'm still wary of this app. But it's very promising. I love the interface design though there's still room for improvement. I personally experience lags while scrolling and I find that hard to navigate when the app keeps doing that. I also think it's better to implement the new emojis on the app but as well for instagram, too. Creating an account is a hassle if you just want to make a fandom one. And I find it a hassle to go to another app just to change my display name. I hope that'll change.Very easy to use because it's just like Twitter. But I'm starting to hate it because Instagram's best traits are being removed. Reactions for chats, and music for stories? Might as well just remove this app threads. Instagram is being loved through posting pictures but it is very convenient for having conversations with reactions if you don't know what to say. Music for stories is also important to express oneself. I just hope the effect on the Instagram app is just temporary.As soon as I opened the app, it went good, the login and all, but as soon as it loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting so weird, like a bug or smth. All pages are overlapping on each other, I can't even interact with anything because as soon I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. Even reinstalling didn't help fix this issueGreat App! Loved it from the very first day although I have the following challenges; 1. My keyboard does not stack with the UI page, it covers it and so I can't see what I'm typing. 2. Can't save images like every other user. 3. From 100+, Can't see the latest follower as an individual to see their profile; have to search. 4. UI gets a little confusing sometimes as there's no proper demarcation between one thread on my timeline and another. 5. Opening some threads crashes the app occasionally.It suddenly closes. I thought I just accidentally hit my home button but no. I was typing but overtime, it suddenly closes. There was even no draft of the text I was composing. Happened multiple times. I just updated this app and thought that it would fix the issue, but no. This is also the reason why I stopped using this the last time, I got frustrated because it kept refreshing(?) or closing and the thread I was composing is not even saved.This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform.It's addicting but feels cramped and messy because there are unnecessary elements like showing the profiles in replies, but it depicts friendliness, so it's good. And I feel like the elements are too close to each other. The app is great because there is no ads, spam, and free from toxic, yet. I hope they can keep the environment safe and toxic free.I don't normally write reviews but I'm so annoyed with this app! I've tried to share a picture about 10 times, both by sharing from my gallery and directly uploading to the app and it's not working. I've tried updating the app and when that didn't work, uninstalling and reinstalling. I'm at a loss. Very frustrating.I think it is great but some features needs to be advanced. First the photo loading time is still slow, secondly I suggest that all Meta Apps could be synced inform of tab/browser where you can switch platforms easly. For example if you are in threads you can have switcheable icons or tabs to navigate to Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and vice versa. Fourthly, there should be filters through which people could determine thematic areas of interest including themes, topics, personalities, etcThere's an annoying glitch that makes this app almost useless, whenever I change tab, such as from activity to feed or profile, their UI overlays on top of each other which makes reading anything is Impossible. I had to minimize and reopen the app in order to make the glitch gone, but only temporarily because the same issue will reappear if I try to change tab again. Please fix this!The application doesn't work and constantly says 'Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again'. This is frustrating. I tried to clean cache and data, reinstall, different internet and wifi connections, with and without vpn, but nothing works. I truly want to use it, but I can't. :( Fix it, please.Interesting App, but somehow the user experience is kinda less user-friendly when already has a lot of users. The threads are mixed up, and it would be great if there is a setting option for an account owner only who can see the \"Replies\" tab instead of showing it publicly (without changing it into a private account). And somehow when I try to modify the settings and navigate back, it always redirects to Instagram App instead, not navigating back to the Threads app.The lack of options when it come to seeing unwanted content you are not following is annoying. If I like certain things the app will bombard me with a bunch of similar content that I'm really not interested in. I try with this app but it got more and more frustrated as I keep on using it. I really wish there was an option to block certain things in my timeline not just in replies.Missing most basic yet most-desired features like saving media! It's intended to replace Twitter but lacks a simple save function for images and videos. People like to SHARE and people like to SAVE media. Every single person on the planet knows and understands this. It cannot and will NEVER replace Twitter as long as it is missing a feature everyone wants, period.So at the moment I have two issues with the app: the first is the feed - there needs to be an option for follow-only feed on something like that, something closer to the Instagram experience. The second issue is the crashes - I know this app is literally two days old but it crashed on me a few times already and it sucks. Other than that, works fine, nice app.Yes, the app is excellent. My experience with this app has been fantastic. I know it's a new challenge for Twitter. Here are my suggestions for the next update: 1. I highly recommend adding a scheduling feature. This would be incredibly useful for creators like me to plan and schedule their Threads in advance. 2. Another suggestion is to incorporate a direct messaging (DM) feature. This would enable users to have private conversations within the app.Great start for a positive space. Like many reviews so far there are things to add to the app to make it better. The search page is a bit bland maybe more like insta? A visual thing. Trending would be good on there too. And instead of the usual drab news stories why not the best most positive news stories circulating. The no ads is a winner for me though that will probably change. I have to say it is a breath of fresh air so far. But it needs to stay a positive place.1-we need a trending list for every region, just like Twitter. So that people can know what's going around the world. 2-when posting pics or videos, it doesn't give us the option to choose from different folders like Twitter does. 3-when typing a long reply, the view doesn't automatically adjust to show what we're typing. Instead, we have to scroll up to see the rest of what we're typing.Really needs a lot of improvement. It's a promising app. Hope you can fix the bugs. Add options to filter what we want to see in our home page. Add DM. Option to add more than one account just like in IG. It's frustrating to go back and forth. Oh well... Hope this app will improve.Very messy to use, filled with threads from irrelevant people, despite the data collection that meta has on all their apps which include health and fitness for some reason. This makes it extremely boring to use, as the algorithm doesn't appear to be able to show any of my interests that it has collected from instagram - seeing as the two apps share the same account. It would be better as part of the instagram app, such as reels, as a section inside there.Update: Threads cannot handle dark mode, and it is automatic. so after 9 p.m. it is impossible to use, at least on Android 9 ------- more than half the time, threads shows a garbled mess of letters on an Android phone. also, threads has no means to report this it sure would be nice if they had some sort of feature to send a picture and show them what it looks like, or simply have a way to message or report an app issueoff to a great start. Obviously it's never gonna be a 5* app upon release, but so far my only gripe is that features which are planned for inclusion aren't there yet. Look forward to when this becomes a more rounded, 'complete' software product. Also, ability to save images would be nice.There's a glitch in the app. Pages are overlapping. Tries every possible aspect to resolve the issue by re-installing, clearing cache & data but still unable to use the application properly. Very disappointing. Finally, uninstalled the application as for now. Whenever the app will improve, will download it again. Till then using that old Twitter.It's a good app and has more restrictions than what Twitter has to offer, but after I transferred my Instagram data, I hadn't been able to open up my Instagram. When I do open, I can only stay on chats that I have been notified in, and if I navigated away from the chat, it crashes on me. I've uninstalled it for a little while, but it still doesn't work. I don't know if it's a thread thing, an Instagram thing, or both, but it started when I downloaded Thread.as of now, i've experienced a few bugs depending on which device i use threads on. on my tablet, everytime i try to post my art the entire app crashes. on my phone, everytime i try to post more than one photo the post reads something along the lines of \"post couldnt be uploaded\". although i do have hope for threads, its very simplistic and easy to use.The data collection on this app is SINISTER. The user agreement has the same function as Facebook where they literally own your images and content, and can use it commercially. Now I can't delete it without deleting my instagram! If you are an artist, avoid this app at all costs. Everyone else, go into your phone data alloance settings and turn off all data allowances for the app. It won't stop the data mining but it might help. Very dangerous for user security.The first day on the app has been really good- I haven't noticed any bad bugs or experienced any crashes. Please add a following-only feed and an option to view in chronological order. That would make the app so much better. Pretty please 🙏 Since this is competing with a certain bird app, a trending page with current events/etc would be really nice and appreciated!I was excited for the app but once it is loaded, I could not even use this app because it started acting weird. All pages are overlapping each other. I can't even interact with anything because as soon as I do, the page starts to behave like a bug. I tried to reinstall but it didn't fix the issue.This version would be decent if we were talking about a beta, but it is the final version and it lacks many QoL improvements. There is no option to see only the threads of people you follow in chronological order, can't use hashtags, the algorithm doesn't take into account the profiles you follow or interact with and recommends anything, cannot perform keyword searches, some videos don't play audio, and many more bugs and non-existing options that should have been there in the first place.Slow, glitchy, and constant crashes! Whenever we try to post something it always ends up in the limbo, garbage experience! Update: no basic features even after month of launching, and glitches and slowness is still same, can't upload anything because it ends up in the limbo, no wonder why this app is losing the game against twitter.Very buggy, initially after getting it, it took over 60 hours before any content showed whatsoever on my feed, despite me following many people and my partner having loads on her feed. Recently, it took me about 48 hours to upload something on it while Instagram and other apps worked perfectly fine. Multiple attempts occurred both on wifi and on mobile data with no results. It'd be really cool if the bugs could get sprayed down some more, maybe get Daxter on it.Such a frustrating buggy experience. Looks promising for us photographers. No apparent restrictions on image size, crop or quality. But I cannot get it to load from within the app or share from my Pixel 7 folders. Weirdly it has just allowed me to post one image from my White border app. 🤷 Of the thousands of images I have to share it literally will only let me share this one image. Plus I experimented with sharing it again but the app refused and just closes. 🤦Well I installed the app out of curiosity and it seems interesting but whenever I open the app, it's all glitch. I'm unable to see a single word perfectly and everything is just messed up on screen. Hope you resolve such bugs and issues soon and be able to provide a great user experience.Its just not working. It was fine for a while but something happened and now whenever I try to check my notifications or write something, it says \"sorry something went wrong\". Tried reinstalling, didn't help, it's simply just broken. I was already disappointed in this half-baked trash that lacks even the most basic functions like hashtags, but at my current state, I'm unable to do anything but refresh the timeline which is filled with unfunny meme accounts and verified scum. Unusable. Zuck lost.For now, only 3 stars! Can see potential in this app, but agree with some about a few improvements. I'd like to see 2 FEEDS! One the current random FEED... to view everything that's happening and connect with new people. And a 2nd FEED (maybe a TAB), that shows the people you already FOLLOW, showing their POSTs... making it quick'n simple at a glance to see what friends are doing. We don't all have time to browse content of a random FEED for POSTs made by those we choose to FOLLOW.Just got the app, tried three times to make a post, and it failed each time. Tried different formats, low character counts, etc. and all in perfect service. It just failed to post. Maybe I'll come back when the app is actually usable.Starting was good like login and editing the bio. But after that when I opened the app to see what type of features and contents it contain. It started glitching and always it acts weird. Didn't expected this type of bad work from Meta. The application needs a lot of development. Looks like it's a launch without trial. Very disappoint. Want to delete my Threads a/c but for that Instagram a/c also will be deleted because thats the algo. Dissatisfied and Disappointed.As a starter this is okay but there are two deal breakers. One is the feed. You get stuff from accounts you don't follow and have no interest in and it cannot be changed. Second, if you log in with instagram, you can't change anything or deactivate profile on threads as it's synced. You have to change or just delete your entire instagram profile.- The UI is a bit clunky. Icons have really thick outlines that heavily compete with text visually. Lines between threads are too thin. - Video players are quite horrible. Sometimes audio never works, sometimes the video perpetually pauses on fullscreen / when tapping the thread. - Most threads I see are from accounts I don't follow. While I think that's good for discovering new accounts upon first launch, I don't see many threads from followed accounts.Continually running into a message, \"Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again,\" on every page. It happened last night and I tried clearing cache, forcing stop, logging in and out. Only thing that fixed it was uninstall/reinstall. And now the same error is happening again. I don't want to have to reinstall this app every few hours.I think it's a decent start. Some features I think would be important going forward, though; the ability to search topics and tags rather than just people. To go along with this, the ability to follow specific topics would do much for the ability to curate a homepage. Also, having an in-app direct messaging system would do much to improve the experience. Other than that, and the fact that this app is still in its infancy, I can see a good potential for Threads as a platform.The app is going well and nice, easy to use, and friendly. But I recommend a delete, edit,and save option. A Delete option to be able to clean the activity or notification. To be able to edit a message or picture to add a caption when it's already posted, and a save and bookmark option. I personally need the delete option, I can't help but get anxiety when my activity is messy. I tried checking a post notification of an activist, but it swarmed up my activity history. Please add options.It's a good app. You can share anything, especially your current thoughts and whatnots. However, I suggest that there should be a choice of interests too so that the contents on home will be filtered with that interest. It will be much more fun to use it if people see what they actually like to see. Hoping for the improvement of algorithms.Not a bad app (it runs smoothly and interfaces well with Instagram) but definitely could be improved. The home page is flooded with completely untailored posts that have nothing to do with any of the accounts I follow. Without tags it is hard to find new accounts to follow based on what I am interest unless the keyword is in their username.Right now, it's a void. Very little of what you actually want to see shows up, and the rest is noise from bigger accounts (verified army) and ads. We'll see what it becomes eventually (your following does creep through every now and then, but not nearly enough). I do think the UI is clean though.App crashes constantly when uploading photos. And the image picker is so basic - can't even pick photos by choosing different folders. Sigh! I hope this gets improved. Other than that, this app has been great so far to browse. I really want to like this app, just fix the posting experience please.I liked the app a lot, but since a week ago it doesn't work properly on my device, and I get a message \"something went wrong\" whenever I try to view a profile, comments or activities. I tried reinstalling the app, deleting cache, restarting my phone, and resetting network settings but I still have this issue.(Notably I am the 1st person to REVIEW this app in English). Apperantly it's USELESS APP... it has Good dark interface, but there are numerous issues 👉 it crashes often without error message, too slow to even update profile section, Can't even upload single image (despite there is with high speed broadband connection), copy paste doesn't work .. \"@\" function (in bio) doesn't work .. not sure if all these issues will get resolved. Otherwise I am going to uninstall it and stop using for forever.While I do think the app has some potential, there are several problems. Some of them include the lack of photo filters when you upload photos, the inability to delete your Threads account without your Instagram account, the inability to use more than one account, and the app crashing several times when I log out, leading myself to delete data and cache rather frequently. I wish this app wasn't released prematurely and that Instagram gives more time to develop Threads as a more stable app.Signed up for my other account via Instagram. Spent time setting up. Tried to post 3 times but every time I pressed the 'post' button after writing the post & adding images - it closed! Not impressed. Only using as I need to be across all social media but really not happy with my user experience on the first day of it going live, & don't like you have to tie it to the Instagram. I'd prefer it to be a standalone platform, it feels like you're being forced to put all your eggs in the Meta basket!The idea behind this app is great! It's quite convenient that it's connected to Insta account. However, experience with it can be improved. Majorly, by changing algorithms of feed to only view Threads of accounts you follow, or by adding a feature to filter your feed manually, to choose whose threads to see. Hope this feedback will be taken into account 🙏🙏🙏10/10 for the UI, it looks cool and clean. But the feed is just infested with suggested content. At least on twitter you can separate the suggested content from the content of entities that you actually choose to follow. Might have some interest in Threads if they implement this feature, but for now... BaiIt's pretty much Facebook's version of Twitter. Unfortunately the app is unstable and lacks basic features find in its parents app, like switching accounts. Whenever I open \"threads\" (replies to a post within the app) the app will crash every other time. It's quite embarrassing to have the main feature bugged. The app is an unoriginal idea and it needs significant improvements. If it worked, could sort feed, switch accounts, and post audio, I'd give 4⭐ I'm using Oxygen OS 13.1 (OnePlus 10 Pro)This app's fatal flaw is it's feed. Almost everytime I go on Threads, my feed is entirely made up of random people I do not follow and do not care about meaning I'll turn off the app almost immediately. This entire app would be saved by splitting the tabs into a following and a discovery one. Right now, it's not worth it.Good for early days, a bit glitchy and lots to build on still. In the middle of writing a post, the app closes down entirely and looses the content so I'm having to write it in my phone notes. If you write a long post, your phone keyboard is in the way as the Threads text box doesn't shift up the more you write, so you can't amend mistakes or text. I'm seeing a heck of a lot of posts from people I don't follow at all and have no interest in. A familiar, simple app though so I like it so far.Terrible in terms of privacy and lacking many essential features, such as a timeline for just those you follow. By using this (and other Meta apps too) you are giving away basically almost everything about you to a company with a horrible track record when it comes to properly handling user data. Try Mastodon instead, it's onboarding process has really improved recently and it has far more features.there's some flaws I've noticed . 1. Reply in thread goes far way bottom, not the below of the thread that meant to be replied 2. Text cursor doesn't follow my typing, need to scroll by myself if it's a long thread 3. I can't save images 4. can't 2x tap to zoom image, I must pinch it to zoom and it's doesn't stay still zooming the image, it always goes back to original size. 5. Video UI/UX is not very interactive and intuitive, can't tell the duration 6. No media bar in profile 7. No hastagsSo, immediate problems: The way to choose files is unsortable and awful. Writing replies to ANY post is frustrating because the keyboard will cover it. Curating your feed is difficult at best and impossible at worst, since at first it only shows verified account's posts— except you literally can't search for topics you enjoy to interact with those and curate your algorithm. I really hope it gets better.Going on two weeks since public launch now and this app is starting to suffer from lack of very common features (which honestly should have been standard at launch). No ability to filter your feed or search posts/tags. Account follower import seems to be messy for those with a larger following. It has some good things like in line thread adding good media display. But, these are not enough to keep the app afloat on their own.I wrote down words and tried to correct for wrong spelling or error in words. After I pressed delete or backwards button, I could no longer write any more words. I had to discard the current thread and tried to write a new thread. In the new one, the error was gone until I pressed delete text button. FYI, It happened in Andriod mobile app when I first wanted to post a new thread. I want you to fix this bug very soon.Worthless so far. I have no idea what the feed is doing. It's not showing me any of the accounts that I follow, and the rare one I do see the post is 20 hours old. There's no way to sort by suggested, followed, most recent, personal lists, anything. There's no hashtags, no way to really search for the content I want to follow. Hurry up and get on adding more features to make this thing functional.A great start, but it needs lots of improvements. Only being able to see posts by followers on your feed for one, an option to edit pictures and videos before you post them, it's also common for the app to crash while trying to upload pictures and videos.With a multitude of auto-playing videos right off the fly of the homepage, it's really difficult to focus on the \"Threads\" that're meant to be the defining feature of this platform. This is basically just Instagram, but with a higher character limit. The unnecessarily large size followed by the lack of data saving features makes this app pretty redundant considering the existence of Twitter.Impossible to use. It gets loaded with pics and text layered on each other infinite number of times and my whole screen turns into a mess. Guess it is not optimized or something. This is the only app that gives me such an issue, and Instagram itself works fine.The app looks promising and at its initial stage that's why there are some complicated parts of it but I do suggest some features such as, messaging feature just like in Instagram; photo cropping and editing feature when posting a picture; circles would also be good; and lastly, ability to look at someone's profile picture. Overall, the app was nice and already makes some people an online friends within just few days of launchSo far I like it! It's very basic and I'm kinda disappointed at the lack of accessibility options such as being able to add alt text but... Overall it has a nostalgic vibe like when social media used to be fun, at least it is for me. Interested to see how it progresses.I've seen a lot of people had the same experience as me. But I'm gonna repeat it so someday it can be fixed. I CAN'T USE IT. Anytime i decide to simply scroll the screen the app explodes into clones of all the things on screen and nothing is visible anymore. PLEASE. LISTEN TO US.Should've launched a stable version. Full of bugs and glitches. Characters overlapping each other while scrolling through making it impossible to figure out. Thorough inspection required. Issues to be fixed at the earliest. Re-installation was futile.Off to a great start! This is a great alternative to other text-based social media! After installing I could import my Instagram profile pic, bio and followed accounts (some of whom are already on the new app). Timeline updates are fast and videos appear to be better quality than similar platforms. My only suggestion is I would like to see a more compact timeline UI or the ability to customize the size of posts so I can read more Threads per screen 😀Surprisingly really nice. Not going to lie. But the image and video quality is so bad. Like the compression is so so so terrible. If that was changed and we could have better video and image quality it would be so much better <33 please add that lol otherwise its actually really nice. Also having a \"following only\" browse feature would be so cool too 👍👍 new feature req. Being able to switch between mult accs!!REALLY impressed!! WHAT I LIKED: so far i haven't experienced any bugs and the app feels very sorted, refined, thoroughly planned and well put together, i might increase my rating when they add some new interesting features, which im sure they will WHAT I DIDNT LIKE: The algorithm, its very random, i actually just want information from people i follow, or maybe a seperate for you page like on Instagram could work too, lacks some features but given the release time, I'll wait gor some.1)When I like something, nothing happens, tye command isn't taken (2)Not smooth at all (3)The colours are dead, make it more interesting and wholesome (4)When I try to Reload a page by swiping down, the symbol keeps on doing the reloading animations over and over again, but the page doesn't change (5) Having trouble using more than one account, like insta. If the option is not there to use multiple accounts, this app is deadApp is clearly not ready for release. Integration with Instagram is great, however the biggest letdown is having the home feed being filled with randos, with no way to make it *only people I follow*. I'm patiently waiting for this issue to improve. Otherwise good concept, UI is great, user experience is okayFor a new app it's great. But, it lacks dark mode which I and several people want/need. I know that they will be adding it, but the home page doesn't show who I'm following half the time and instead is showing other people I have little to no interest in. As well as this, the lack of tags seems to be a problem if it's not added soon. Other then that, a very good start and already better then Twitter.It's decent, but it definitely needs a few interface improvements. Hasn't crashed or anything, which is nice. However, a huge problem is that my entire feed is taken up by people I don't follow or have any interest in despite being logged in. Makes it completely uselessCan't get through the setup process. I want to manually select who of my Insta followers to follow in Threads, and twice now I've spent a fair while going through the list only to have it shut down when I get to the end before I can continue to the next stage. It reverts back to the start, and I have to redo my profile and select everyone again only for the same thing to happen. I don't have time for this.Won't like me sign up. Can't create an account, get stuck after inserting the code that's sent, just won't go forward. Utterly pointless. Update: After hours of trying I've given up. Constantly getting error messages & the runaround. Clearly still work to be done on this platform. So l'm going back to Twitter. Threads is useless. #twitterBugs still not fixed and it has been a while now since launch. Pasting attempt, it highlights the first section when attempting to paste at end of message. New line half way through message creates a new thread in a thread. Large images still probably crash the phone. Cannot have feed for just followers. Hashtags don't do anything e.g. don't change colour, not searchable. Etc etc. Happy to update rating once fixed. S23Ultra 1Tb.I give 3 star because sometimes I can't upload a video, I have to try it next day, the service is not strong not constant, I like the interface but I suggest a private message, it would be very cool instead of switching to Instagram for private message. It really mess me up. I can't have a private with my friends. More mess😫It's a great start! I do feel like when adding photos we should have the ability to choose what album we pick from bc I have a ton of images on my phone and scrolling to hunt for them in 10k images isn't fun. Also I feel like there should be in app DMs as that's part of what makes things like Twitter so usable the ability to talk to our friends about threads or post. To what I DO love is the ability to add more than four photos at a time, the ability to write long multi post threads.There's a bug when using this app on Galaxy S23 Ultra. When i open the app, on home screen it's showing blank and only displays bottom icons . When i click on other icons they are responsive. I thought it was a slow network issue, tried to rest the phone but nothing. I hope this will be addressed via an update.has lots of potential! people are complaining that its missing aome basic features, which it is. but they were mostly focusing on making sure the app runs smoothly, which it does. has almost completely replaced taitter for me already and with some good quality of life upgrades it can be much better than twitterSo far, so good. I like the layout and ease of use. And that any follower from IG that uses it automatically follows you. Choosing which image I want to post could be better. Instead of showing me ALL my photos, let me pick the folder to look it up. That's really my only complaintWorse than twitter in nearly every respect. When the hype dies down, everyone will be back on twitter in a week. Also keeps crashing every time when I click replies now. You have to create an Instagram account to sign up as well. Edit: also keeps crashing when I try and make a thread. At least it has quite a smooth interface (carbon copy of twitter though).Not a bad app, could use a couple extra features. The ability to not see re-threads (turn off retweets), ability to download photos, and If you really want to pass up Twitter, Let us edit our posts after they've been posted... Maybe add a \"Close friends\" sorting option as well like with Instagram.A good first step but many bugs still needing to be fixed. The most egregious is that the on screen keyboard overlays the input area so you can't see what you're typing. Since this is what I would consider a major bug, I'm rating this app accordingly.There's a lot to be desired for on this app I would like to see a \"This person follows you\" badge on someone's profile who follows me. A feed option of only accounts that I do follow. And most of all, being about to choose specific folders from my gallery to post pictures and videos from. The app is smooth, but uploading photos sometimes crashes it. Otherwise I can see this being a potential killer for Twitter.I recently tried out this app and it's not bad but requires some improvements. One major issue is the lack of a clear indication for new posts, making it difficult to stay updated. The app also needs a better layout with clear indications of posts to enhance user experience. Additionally, the mixing of posts and replies without clear separation adds confusion. Despite these drawbacks, the app has potential.Hello, I'm facing some problems with the theme of Threads. I was hoping to use a dark mode, but unfortunately, my phone's system lacks that option. Therefore, I kindly request if it would be possible for you to enhance the theme, considering that many others might also be experiencing similar difficulties, especially those who prefer a dark mode. I hope this feedback reaches you and serves as inspiration to address this matter. Thank you.Has potential but also has some issues. So I can see this platform becoming very fun to use in the future but it has some glaring issues. One of which being that anytime I try to upload multiple images, the app crashes almost instantly. There's also no Media tab and no way to trace what you've liked or commented on.So far it's pretty peaceful. I appreciate that there's a pop up telling me that I might be posting something that could be deemed a problem(even if they're wrong), instead of the way FB will just arbitrarily ban me. I am getting a \"Threads failed to upload error.\" This is annoying since other apps are uploading just fine.Migration was supposed to be the great thing. I had to go find most of the people I follow. Notifications don't work even though they are turned on to the people I want to hear from. This is a rushed app. Not original. Feels like a partially completed term paper. Not impressedI can't post anything. It always just says \"failed to upload\". I've tried everything, updating everything, posting short things, restarting my phone, different networks and mobile, uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times and reporting the issues and no success or response. So it's basically unusabyfor me.Great app!!! However, I am experiencing bugs from time to time that limits my usage of the app. 😔 Sometimes my timeline won't refresh, sometimes it displays that I haven't posted threads yet even though I have, and I can't browse my notification bar because they cannot be clicked and are grouped together. I'll try to uninstall and install again, maybe that way I'll have a better experience when using the app. It has a big potential!!The app interface is bugged. I can't even read anything because when I scroll it, the interface becomes a mess. It's like the frames of the scrolling animation are getting stacked on top of each other making it impossible to distinguish anything.Good start, needs some key features. It auto populates your feed based on what it thinks you'd like, as opposed to who you follow. There also needs to be more filters, so you can really tailor your experience. But so far, it's clean, fun, and like early social media. Please don't let it be spoiled by ads, businesses, etc.Pointless. It's a Twitter lite without any of the fun. Heavy handed moderation and no searches or hashtags. It lacks any useful features and the content will be gone soon if they don't quickly release features and lighten up on their policies. I'll probably uninstall it in a week, not worth the extra battery drain and Facebook tracking in its current state.The idea of the app is fun. It feels like a safe space where people are sharing thoughts and ideas. There are a few bugs, sit crashes often and it has slowed down IG as well. But it's a new app. I'm not expecting perfection yet since it was only launched a week ago.The app is still new and I have installed the app for the first time. The setup was easy to do. One thing that I would love to see on the app is that you can upload videos on Threads and the other thing is that you can delete your profile and data because I have read that the only way to delete the data is to delete your Instagram account which I don't like because it's going to upset people when they want to delete their threads data.Excellent. The UI was clean and the navigations were easy. There was few minor bugs encountered. The app was stable and the experience was seamless. Very easy to reach out to connections and people. Very similar its competitor, twitter.Won't like me sign up. Can't create an account, get stuck after inserting the code that's sent, just won't go forward. Utterly pointless. Update: After hours of trying I've given up. Constantly getting error messages & the runaround. Clearly still work to be done on this platform. So I'm going back to Twitter. Threads is useless.edit after a few days: Ok the randomness was fun for a bit, but its continued usability for me hinges completely on search. Search is still the biggest advantage of Twitter and the reason many are still unwilling to move. If they screw up search I am dropping this app like a hot potato. \n",
            "\n",
            "I'm loving Threads so far! 🌈🌟 but it can't replace Twitter for me until it has >>> FULL-TEXT SEARCH WITH FILTERS <<< We need a way to find stuff without waiting for the algorithm to drip-feed us.It's refreshing to be somewhere not [insert rival app here], but the app needs work: 1) Chrono order timeline (seeing the same non-followed accounts is boring). 2) In addition, if you want to stick w/ the current timeline (For You), fine, but give us a Following timeline as well. 3) For brands/social media managers that work on multiple accounts, please implement an easier way to switch accounts than having to log out then log in (it gets annoying). 4) Please add a way to schedule posts. Thanks!A Twitter clone that is in internal closed alpha stage. The app sucks big time. Lacks on features and polish. Recommender algorithm straight up sucks. It almost feels like non existent. I guess it wasnt something meta invested in wholeheartedly. Also the biggest bummer is the Instagram mindset of the users. People can't be forced to morph into the forum like UX it provides. Absolutely no reason to switch from Twitter or Mastodon. Also no data transparency.Its cool but here are some issues i see. First off you have no hashtags, you cant search topics, no dm feature, you cant add a backdrop picture. First week you could share a link and the thumbnail would show. Today it only show the link in preview and then minimizes to just the link when posted....something people are less likely to click on. Some people are not dealing with that issue. Cant claim you have an app that will allow more EXSPOSURE and things like that are missing or glitching out.Very clean app with user-friendly interface. But there are things that still needs to be fixed. There should be a place to turn off automatic video playing. And there should be a place to add multiple accounts using Facebook format.The fact that you can't make your dash chronological is bad enough, but the fact that there's absolutely no way to only see content from people you've chosen to follow? Ew. I don't want to see boring celebrity thoughts that are boosted just cuz they're ~verified~, I want to see my friends' art. Hoping you make some updates so I can give this one a better review later, but for how it is now I most likely won't end up using it.I just wish this app had translation capabilities. 😪 I follow some very successful and super nice people from Japan and South Korea. I'm trying to learn how to read both languages, but translation capabilities would make it a little easier.While it is similar to Twitter, it is not exactly the same. Threads has a lot to offer and at the same time a little too much. I don't require the threads of people I don't follow and also has some security issues like it is possible to upload explicit images publicly and offensively criticising the threads but at the same time it diversified our opinions. It can be added as an extension to insta, which can make it more user friendly and if used appropriately it is a great app opportunityUsing Threads is a wonderful experience! Though with the flood of company/official accounts randomly on my timeline, it's too similar to other related app competitors. Accesibility with linked photos (ALT Text) is not there like how Instagram does, and there's no PC version to make it easier to bring in those who are used to the feel of making threads similar to, again, other competetor sites.Update fixes this issue🖤 - Good. Not Great I really can't believe in order to change my profile picture as a verified user I have to do it via Instagram and even when I do it from there it does not change. It is said that I need to subscribe and give ID in order for me to have a display picture. Kind dumb and unfairAbsolutely great. For a first version this has been good so far. Keep it up, having just abandoned Twitter,this is a solid 'alternative'. The first version is stable,reliable and I've not run into any sort of questionable buggy issues. Keep it up! I love it,and I explored most situations relating to UI etc within the app. Truly ,keep it up META & IGI like the app, although the UI isn't super intuitive. I'm sure improvements will be made there. My main issue is that the app is constantly crashing when I open a thread to view replies. This makes the app essentially unusable. My rating will go up or down depending on how long it takes them to fix this...It has potential. First of all the scrolling feels really sticky. Second, the search function doesn't let you search for threads only usernames. Lastly, similar to Instagram, there is no way to change the main feed's settings to only show posts from people you follow.The application is really good but it still needs some amendments like; 1) Smoothness: the app is somewhat slow when scrolling to the top feeds. 2) Ability to save: as usual, not everyone would like to screenshot something that he/she is supposed to save. 3) Ability to change name and tag. Way to go Meta. 4) Ability to translate from one language to another. 5) Videos don't have sounds in the owner's profile. 6) When commenting on a picture, you can't see what you are trying.I was really enjoying Threads until today, yes it definitely needs work with the feed and following but over time that will improve I'm sure. However, as of an hour ago, everytime I try to reply to a thread, it crashes as soon as I type the first letter? Hope you fix this ASAP! I really don't want to go back to Twitter! 😭 Update! Started working again after I posted this review! 🤣 Fingers crossed it keeps that way ☺ Further update! Same stupid crashing issue when trying to reply, grrr 😡I believe that this app has potential, but there are a few features missing that would make the experience better. One feature that should be implemented is an explore tab, where you can find threads from people you do not follow. There could also be a tab that shows you popular threads at the time.I have major issues logging in, whenever I switch it Instagram I instantly get logged out saying that the user might have changed the password when the password remains the same. The same thing happens when I open the threads app. Has a lot of potential otherwise. The app continuously keeps crashing as well as InstagramIt's look like duplicate of Twitter application, but I believe you have to work on image click bug. Whenever we are clicking on any image then instead of zooming like in Twitter image is getting little bit up and down (like vibration). So just amend some parameters in image click it will improve your application.This is a pretty easy to use platform with a well made app. I dislike having to make an Instagram account to join Threads, but I did it anyways. Also, there seems to be a bug with the search function because it sometimes shows no results.I enjoy this app. The UI is clean, easy to navigate, and smooth, although it definitely needs a few more features for it to really compete. It would be nice to show only accounts you follow or create a \"For You\" page that shows you posts that relate to your interests.\"Sorry, something went wrong.\" I've deleted the cache, reinstalled the app, reset my connection; nothing's worked. Shame. I like the app, unfortunately I have not been able to use it for over a week. Cannot do anything besides scroll the timeline because I keep getting the error.It probably would be a good app if it actually works. When I open it it glitches as soon as I scroll leaving all the posts I've scrolled past in the background. Even when I change tabs to look at my profile it remains. Uninstalling and reinstalling does nothing to solve the issue. Unusable app.Generally like it but there are almost constant issue with it loading & refreshing. Would like some additional features added as well. It's new, so I expect there to be bugs, but it's getting incredibly frustrating.Well, lemme admit that it has such a good ui, & ux as well... although the real challenge for now is the algorithm, its random rn, obviously its new... but i hope it'll be improved in next versions. The design team did such a great work. We would love to have a quick demo of design system published on Figma, or Instagram design. Best of luck.for an app that feels like it's in beta, it's decent enough. should be way more polished. I have found bugs in media uploading, already widely reported, but also in the titulary threads feature. sometimes duplicate posts show up if u delete something and repost it. other than that, it's a bit empty, needs voice clips, and a button to DM pplSo far so good. I know a new app will take multiple updated to implement all the changes needed, so I will give it time to let us choose folders and albums we want to post media from. Otherwise, it's a really easy to use app.It's alright for now,but let's see how it goes after the perfect algorithm kicks in and some features added. Would love it if u can seperate each tweet/ thread more clearly cuz it feels a bit\"compact\" and not \"comfy\" and better search too. Looking forward to how it goes.There are no reviews yet? Anyways, it's down on my end right now. Few suggestions: explore and trending (or \"threadsetters\") tab, edit button, likes and media tab, ability to save photos and videos, user generated alt text on photos, tagging users on photos/videos, cover photo, location tagging, and zooming/viewing of profile photosCannot save pictures & crashes posting pics! Twitter allows you to save any picture; Threads blocks downloads. On Twitter, I can easily post a picture; Threads crashes if I try to post a picture. Ridiculous! So far, this has been a pretty miserable app! I hope they fix it soon.It's good but has a few kinks. It needs settings like an in-app dark mode instead of it being tied to my phones settings. Along with features like direct messaging. Ads don't seem too intrusive but I'd like to see more in my feed from people I followNo Dark mode, by far the biggest crime No way to create an account inside the app, you have to have an already existing account No desktop version, for an app like this to thrive it gotta have that Upon logging in you are stuck in an infinite loading loop on the main page, only once you close and open the app again does it properly load The attach icon could be moved to the side instead of under the reply so I don't need to scroll each time I wanna attach a photo Fix this ASAP, till then have 1Threads has definitely grown on me, the algorithm has also gotten drastically better for me which helps a lot. It's only little problems I have with the app now. Wish there was an option to hide reposts from people I follow. Really wish we could pinch and zoom on images; and wish videos would unmute when opened. Otherwise, this is a tremendous first release. It seems to accomplish the goal of Twitter's For You page well and in a way that is enjoyable to use.The Thread app is a fantastic tool for staying organized and connected with your friends, family, and colleagues. With its sleek and intuitive interface, it provides a seamless messaging experience that keeps conversations focused and clutter-free. One of the standout features of the Thread app is its unique threading system. It allows you to create separate threads within a conversation, making it easyThe app as a platform is great, besides the interface and stuff... but one only issue is that scrolling is low smooth plus I would like to suggest some ways to make Threads go incredibly stylish, such as the like button animation and the app's icon color matching for android 13+ However it's an excellent app that's looking to be perfect, thank you Marks crew 👌-Need quick account switch function, I have to log out an log in each time for my multiple accounts. -Feed algorithm is way too random, close friends threads should be prioritized over everything else -Obvious features missing such as text character limit counter, media tab in profile -Hope the app will be more flexible like Twitter, like be able to see people's profile pictures full, etc -At the moment, the app is giving me kind of claustrophobic feeling due to missing features and UI, boring.I dont know what happened but as soon as I log in into threads, its kind of a bug or something, my screen suddenly starts acting weird and the title and post begins to flicker. I reinstalled it many times but didn't worked. I can't even read a thing.This feels like a beta version of an app. Was rolled out way too soon with the hopes of cashing in on the temporary Twitter rate limit issue. The app is a mess right now - no following tab, no way to turn off reposts from followers, no search button for topics, TL not in chronological order, no way to save pictures, no GIFs, no DMs, no Trending topics. Will never replace Twitter if these issues aren't fixed.I understand it just released, but there's a lot to improve. Some things I think should be fixed/added: the option to search for tags or words; too many accounts I don't follow on my tl; chat system; stories; show the quotes for threads; allow us to select from gallery folders when selecting pics to post Edit: new issue, the app keeps closing whenever I try to post somethingCan't post 50mp photos in the app. The app crashes upon upload to a thread. But the standard sized photos seem to work fine. Would love to see more discovery options like using hashtags etc. I'm sure more things are in the works. The app works pretty fluid on my S23U. Nice!Great app, but I think 2 issues have to be fixed,, First, it's gonna be better if the pictures/photos are downloadable, Second, when writing using 2 languages like Arabic & English in one thread, the order of the text gets messed up, so for a socialmedia where writing threads is the thing, I believe fixing this issue is necessary. Overall, creating this platform and this app is a great idea.I've only been using it for a day but so far so good. Feedback: the ability to save photos and post/reply with gifs. There's also no option to go through my folders in my gallery so when I pull up my gallery it's just all my photos and no way to access the different folders. The ability to sort the feed from either top or latestHas a display picture uploading bug. I've tried to change my profile pic on 3 different devices but its still stuck as the plain white default one. Aside form this bug, the app is great, nice and simple. I enjoyed Twitter a lot before. I'm curious to see how the Threads vs Twitter fight goes.The application works fine without problems, but there is a very noticeable minus there is no transfer in Threads, and you need to make two buttons, the first recommendation, the second on which you are subscribed, this is my personal opinion, otherwise 4 stars, I hope the developers will notice this, and by the way, me too programmerWhere to start! As highly anticipated app and I'm glad this feature were to exist as part of Instagram but as soon I'm finished with getting started I'm met with all screen bug (flashing, misplaced repeated jittered clones of everything everywhere) I'd wish I could send an internal feedback on it with attachments but can't due to bugs. // device info: Android version: Android 9 (FuntouchOS_9.1) Software version: PD1930CF_EX_A_1.18.0Pretty good app apparently it's like classic Twitter. It could use a few tweaks and adjustments especially the ability to edit your thread and better audio support for videos as well as gif insertion, also a timeline just for the people you follow would be great too, but otherwise it's solid.I like the concept, and it's good to start. However, it needs to be easier to follow people in your feed without opening the post and harder to highlight text. I kept accidentally highlighting while scrolling and clicking on posts when trying to follow someone.Overall I love the app. However.... I have not been able to follow new people or follow back any of my new followers for over 3 days now and I can not get anyone to help with this issue. Ive even tried to become verified but guess what can't do that either. This is very very frustrating!!!!! 3 stars because of this issue could be 5 if someone from support could help me out.** 5 days now so I'm going to start dropping the stars.It's a good app ...but then things need to be corrected ... Work on typing, You need to see what you are typing ... Not just typing blindly.. ,,,while using the app replying a post with a photo media the media blocks your view and you can't see what you are typing ... Plus the post button should be easily accessible.. Work on interacting with your users that's why your notification is there. Send a notification to notify a user if the user have been limited to carryout some certain activitiesNo interaction with people you follow. Period. You'll be lucky to see a post that isn't a business or verified account. No rhyme or reason to posts that the feed shows you. This is the same as the ad riddle Instagram platform but worse at this point in time. If you could filter by only people you follow, MAYBE this would salvageable. But as it is now this isn't worth using over Instagram or any other service. There's little to no functionality and it's not even close to chronological.App with Limited Login Options I recently tried out an app that caught my interest due to its promising features and positive reviews. However, my experience quickly turned sour when I realized that the app did not allow login with a Google ID. This limitation significantly hindered my ability to conveniently access the app and affected my overall user experience. One of the main advantages of using Google login is the convenience it offers. With just a few taps, I can seamlessly access.Overall, the app is good. Its performance is great for it being initial release. A few suggestions: -Ability to only see followed accounts on timeline -Trending page -Cover photo -Dark mode Pros: -My system font works on this app, while it doesn't work on other similar apps.Seemed like a great new alternative at first, but it still has Instagram's garbage moderation and is constantly crashing on me. You open it up and see nudity, slurs, and threats immediately and the moderation team just goes \"nah its staying lol\" and that's it. Still better than the alternative, but not by muchApp keeps crashing and is effecting my Instagram (it keeps crashing) when I delete Thread my Instagram works fine. But when I download Thread again both my apps glitches. Thread prevents me from mentioning anyone, the app closes and if I'm typing a long Thread the app will close. There is a bug in the system. Need an update ASAP.Missing features: - Selecting text while typing, we can't select to delete, cut, or copy ! - Right-text alignment for Arabic .. - The search bar is only for searching threaders not threads‘ content about a specific topic .. I faced an error: I turned on notifications for an account, then later turned them off, still sending notifications. Unfollowed then re-followed the account, notifications persist. I restricted the account yet receiving them !!This thing is joyless. It has the basic functions of insta but with words. No way to control what you see on you dashboard, or even order things chronologically. I will see one or two posts from people I follow before there's an endless stream of influencer and celebrity thoughts that I don't follow or care about. I tried it for a day and will not be using it again unless there are major changes and way more memes.it's on a good start to be a good socmed app, i just have some problems with it: 1. there is only a for you page, you have to see what the algorithm wants you to see and there's no way to only see posts from accounts you follow. 2. it could he more clear with the data it's taking. simply saying \"other data\" when explaining what data meta takes from us is not transparent. 3. the search section sucks, there is no trending page, no hashtags, and you can only search for accountsIt functions almost exactly like Instagram except worse in the way that your feed is literally no one you follow, just a bunch of suggested people. There seems to be little to no option to toggle that, which at *least* IG does. Also come up with a more fun and silly name for resharing posts the way \"retweet\" exists? \"Reposting\" is a completely different concept. Like the right-click save + reupload kind. That would add like a modicum of personality, at least :/UPDATE: App works perfectly fine since the update. ORIGINAL REVIEW: The app runs fine, but I can't check out my account's Following list, as well as other accounts Following lists either to follow accounts I recognize from other platforms (the same Following list error/glitch has been happening on Instagram, too). Hopefully this error/glitch will be addressed soon in a future app update.Doesn't work at all. I'm unable to check notifications nor my profile (\"Sorry, something went wrong.\" error). I also can't post anything (\"Your thread failed to upload.\" error). Additionally threads in feed are displayed randomly, threads from people i follow are almost impossible to spot in between so spammy, unrelated content.It's a good start at competition for Twitter but more work is needed. I cannot search for specific posts, suggestions for who to follow is not something I have seen, and finally there should be a web version sooner than later. For most of us looking for a Twitter replacement, it's much faster to replicate a followers list on a full keyboard tha it is on mobile.I am facing an issue with this application. Whenever I am trying to reply or quote a video the application shuts off by itself and that video disappears. It's happening from the day one that I had downloaded threads. Please fix that problem. Thank you.Media consumption is mediocre, the default audio setting for videos are muted. You have to click the tiny mute icon to unmute it instead of just pressing your volume up button. Could you please fix that and make it like Instagram's controls? Every video I tap on, I end up skipping to the end because the hit box on the mute/unmute button is so tiny.there's no point in following user profiles because their content can't be seen on my homepage. instead my homepage is drowning in an ocean of junk content that the app has decided i should want to view, but that i don't care for at ALL. i can't even find threads using the search bar, only profiles. and following a profile is nearly useless anyway because their content is NOWHERE to be seen on my homescreenThis app definitely has potential but I have one giant problem. It glitches insanely where if I scroll, the text and photos get dragged along with it. I dunno how to explain it, but I posted a screenshot of my experience with it on dammit.bekah though I think it's just a me problem.The app is very messy, there's a strange effect where I see every post as an afterimage, smeared across the screen. I look forward to seeing what the app is like, after the issue is resolvedThis app surprisingly is a lot like Twitter minus a lot of the negative stuff. But it's clean sleek you. I really shows you how little there is to do on either platform. You can't direct message anybody, it's even hard to see what my friends are actually saying. My whole feed is a bunch of people I've never met, I don't follow, and no one's reposting it that I follow. Overall a solid experience compared to Twitter but somehow this app makes you realize how boring it is.The app, I think, is cool. It still needs work. I wish when you're about to post a picture there was a way to choose what gallery album to go into. It gets annoying having to scroll through all my pictures to find what I need.Pretty good so far. I just have some minor problems. First: Push notifications for individual profiles don't seem to be working at the moment. I've turned push notifs on for multiple accounts, I've seen that they've posted multiple times now, and I never got a notification for any of those posts. Second: I don't like that the feed shows so many people that I don't followIt's pretty glitchy, not going to lie. I'm going to uninstall it for now because it keeps saying \"Sorry, something went wrong. Try again later\" no matter what i did, it just would not work, so I can't even use it anyways, what the point of using up storage space. I like the idea though, it's just too early. Maybe I'll reinstall it in a couple weeks? A month? 2 months? How long do you think it takes to get all the glitches out?I really love this app, but dear Devs, please help: I was in the zone with the bad internet, where I got an error saying that the feed cannot be loaded. But when I came home, the problem didn't disappear. And unfortunately, I still cannot post for some reason, see my threads and likes. I cleaned cache, reinstalled the app, checked the network access. How can I solve this?Bakwas app! I felt hopeless, after close the app! Too much negative news poling! App is crashing while something write here, Just like, If I add paragraph, losing the words, why? Fix this. And that's not finish. We can't save photos from posts that like most! More over, Videos are voiceless! Very bad experience!!Not perfect but could be great if they begin minor improvements like hashtags and more comprehensive search. Runs really smooth and UI is clean and simple. Hopefully it doesn't get too bloated and busy like Instagram. A lot better than the cess pool that is Twitter.Personally, I think the way u arranged the username and userID/accountID is very confusing: -In the Search page, the hierarchy of a profile goes from userID to username; but after u go into their profile page, the hierarchy is the complete opposite -Makes me wondering again which one is ID which one is name -It feels like u combine the interface of twitter and IG, but it turned out confusing instead -I suggest maybe try to arrange the consistency of the hierarchy next time u update the app? TqThe app is good, but the app is unnecessary. With a/an Facebook/Instagram/Twitter previously in use, I find minimal usage for a [new] version of the same apps. Also... you will delete your personal IG account when you delete Threads, which is not only redundant, but a directly violation of my intellectual rights, and there is no NDA, MOU/MOA, or any other contractual agreements within the terms and agreements, prior to you logging in, and/or your account being pre-setup by the [app], itself.I realize the app is in its infancy, but this thing is really inconvenient. I can only use the app from my phone to post. I can't use it on my laptop at all, not even taking something from my Instagram page and crossposting. Please fix this. Allow us to post from devices other than just phones. I have failing eyesight and this becomes a real problem for me because my phone screen (and anything I write using it) is so small.Meh, I'm on the fence about it. I know it's new but it has a bunch of things that needs fixing. The timeline, if that's what it's called, needs to show stuff from who I follow, not everyone. I'll check the replies for those comments. Need a dark mode option and ability to make fonts BIGGER and maybe a bold option as well. Also a definite need is when you open the app or refresh the thread, don't go all the way to the top. Keep the thread where I left off, thanks.Glad to be on board and excited to use the app, but on Android, we can only access our \"gallery\" and not photos from individual folders, which means I can't find any of the photos I want to share. Attempting to share multiple photos from the \"photos\" app results in the app crashing.The concept of the app is good. But the app needs some optimization. There are some glitches in the app And it's draining my device's battery. So after some times, I need to fixed my battery issues. Make threads more compatible. Please fixed this problems as soon as possible.Missing a bunch of things I would like (some of which they eventually plan to add). Since it is still in its infant phase there are some bugs and hiccups that need to be fixed such as the homepage glitching out while reloading, lack of order in which posts will arrive on the feed etc.The timeline is chaotic. There should be a way for individuals to control/choose what they wanna see and who they wanna read. Also, there should be a way to turn off automatic media (video) play. Other than these, the app is going to be an amazing one.This is likely the most overhyped program in the history of forever. The news feed desperately needs filters and there's just not a lot of organization or structure to it. It's basically just a reformatted version of Facebook.So far, so good. I would like there to be a viral feature or something that allows me to actually see the posts of the people who I'm following. All I've been seeing are random blue check marks all morning. Another problem is that the app keeps crashing when I try to see the replies to other people's posts. Every time. It's annoying. I know it's a new app, and I'm just saying that there needs to be a few fixes. Thank you for the new opportunity to grow.An excellent start to a new social network! The app runs smoothly on my Pixel, it hasn't crashed once for me. Yes, this Meta app collects data, but if you already have Facebook and Instagram installed on your phone, adding Threads doesn't make a difference. Love the interface, it's clean and easy on the eyes.A great first experience considering that it's a v1 app. thing to improve, app crashes are frequent, looks a little weird on large screens (tablets), and a lot of missing features. what makes it special tho is that it kinda reminded me of the first few years of Twitter.It's ok but it's missing a lot of features and some of the things it has already is pretty buggy. I can't get videos to play with sound on. Either you watch with no sound or it freezes immediately.There are way too many random people on my timeline. The algorithm is terrible because they don't even appear on my Instagram. They are not related to anything I interact with. I'd prefer it if the default tab were to be for mutuals only.I like how the app loads much faster and lighter than others, the ui is appealing But some things are much needed to be added to the app: 1.Trending 2.Search by post text 3.Saving images to gallery 4.Saving/Bookmarking threads 5.Dark mode for OLED screens (completly black), this may be optional \"Two types of dark mode and one light mode or more to choose from\" 6.When typing english words between arabic words text flips (I think this is a bug)This is a quick suggestion! While uploading files their is no option to navigate to sub directories... You only have an option to upload via gallery as a whole... I mean only all the media from the phone is visible.. No navigation option for subdirectory is available... Please incorporate the change.So far the hype is promising. However if you can adjust your \"post\" button after typing a message i have to click the \"back\" button to access the \"post\" button which will be hidden behind the keyboard. Kinda inconvenient - but of course it's not the finished product yet....Good app for early days but would like to see quick adoption of more standard features like a sort button on the home page, better search features, a dedicated friends list and better integration with the other meta apps. Great for a launch product though.So far a smooth interface, but these are to be worked on; a) App has no dark theme, it bugs when you try linking with Instagram settings. b) To be more interactive, users should read quotes. c) You can't save/download media. d) Having a trend table would widen the public discourse. e) The profile page looks bland, a header should be added, then a face lift. f) When typing, my keboard covers my text. I can't see what I type. g) a DM feature should be added. h) App settings made independent.Not bad as a new app.. however, it does need a few improvement of features as well as some new features... I hope also that it will be allowed to navigate through different accounts just like Instagram. I have multiple accounts for multiple purposes and I would like to have separate threads accounts that are easily navigated through.Overall a good experience so far, however could be improved. I have only used it for a day but inability to properly search by topics makes me feel like I see posts which are irrelevant to me than the posts which I can relate to. It would be helpful to have hashtags available but I understand that at the moment, the app is a new launch and still has a lot of development to go through. Hopefully will be able to give five stars in the future.Super buggy, attachments crash the app any time I try one as a reply, or if it was a screenshot in my gallery, or if it's a large image. Also my keyboard pops up and covers what I'm typing so I can't see typos. Super unpolished app.Pros -Friendly UI design -Easy account transfer -Complimentary addition to Instagram Cons -Default For You/Following Page mashed together -Search function searches users and not keywords, mentions, or tags -No messaging funtion through Threads -No \"exploring\" page (similar to that of Instagram's \"Search\" Page I'm sure the cons I listed are slated to be updated/changed/implemented; However cons such as these should have been considered before launch. Considering compeition.The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..It is a great app. but still need an improvement. it would be great if you message feature to share a thread to your friend because right now share through other app is the only way. maybe a feature to know people who follow you back and to view liked thread. last, add the ability to add gif to your thread.There's some features missing at the moment which is understandable and I look forward to future updates but there's a huge issue for me on this app. I try upload more than one photo it crashes and refuses to open for a few minutes hopefu this can be fixedI haven't run into many issues, mostly because I'm not much of a poster so I'm not adding photos and everything else, BUT the past couple of days my feed is full of accounts I don't follow. Sometimes it's because someone I follow commented or rethreaded it, but that's not usually the case anymore. I use the app to keep up with and engage with the people I actually follow, not everyone elseIt is good. It feels fun and addictive in some way. However, I feel that Twitter was better because it had tags and we could browse current events and news. These features unfortunately don't exist in Threads. I hope that tags and searching for news or specific topics would be added to the app.I am giving it a two star because I appreciate what you'll are trying to give us,but I wished that there could be more functions available in it. Like a translation option it will help us because some of the thing in it are from a different language so to understand that we need a translation option. I look forward for more development in this application and wish that you won't ignore this review and look into the matter deeply.Update: i tried to reinstall the app to find that they changed the system and prevent us from sign up with email and that we have to use the Instagram account !!! If i want to make account aside from insta why forceing me to not to do it ? I tried to sign up but in the last step when you have to agree to the policy i tap agree but my process end their, everything was good till this step , agree just start reload than nothing happened and than tap again and the sameI absolutely loving my time in here. However, there needs to be a dedicated feed for people you follow and not just random people mixed in with followed. And for the mixed feed, it needs to be based on your interests. Right now the posts mixed in your feed are from completely random people with no rhyme or reason. Even people speaking different languages. A huge flaw in this app. It also needs a proper, fully functioning website.There is no need to build and launch this app. However, if zuke wasted a lot of money in copy paste work. The app is useless. It crashes, features doesn't work, @ is not working, design is not very user-friendly, and why it is connected to Instagram?User experience is very good compared to Twitter, but some features are missing, for example I can't on my profile people I m following, and I also can't see others following list, hope this feature will arrive soon, and the logo of the app is not looking professional. Hope they don't add promoted content too much, like Twitter.It was working fine then all of a sudden logged out and logged me out of Instagram. I was able to log back in to Instagram but not Threads. Trying to reinstall but now it's not installing. (?) Update: Was able to reinstall. I don't know what happened. Maybe a possible hack? Good thing I have some safety precautions in place.Love it so far but it needs improvement. It really needs hashtags. And I hate that celebs and business' are what you mainly see. I wanna see the smaller people. I want to be able to find artist. And I want a way to share my post to people who would be interested in it rather than hopeing a stranger likes it. The algorithm is working but it could use improvement.So far, so good. It's still in the early stages, and more features are being created as it's used, but so far, the experience has been great, and the community is supportive, positive, and helpful. There seems to be a concerted effort on the new users to block disinformation, hate speech, racism, and focus on sharing facts and real news.Needs filters for the newsfeed. I don't care about \"things that might interest you\"! I just want to see the posts of the people that I follow, that's IT! Overall, a nice app, but too much spam from the suggested content. Needs filters. Badly.Needs a TON of work, but I will hold out hope. There is no real search. No GIF keyboard. Some glaring bugs. Definitely released early, but with that in mind, it is quite smooth for what it does.Simplified is one of the many AI tools I have tried and is my favorite so far. I appreciate the rewrite tool (it is the one I use the most). Sometimes I can't get my thoughts together, but this tool perfectly organizes and cleans up those thoughts for me. I can rely on it to provide me with a professional and clean rewrite copy which I have used to update my resume. This is just one of the few things it does other than being able to continue your writing or (pun intended) simplify it.Good start. Missing some very useful features that are on the... bird app (and other social media platforms) like a followers/following only feed, and the UI could use some touching up, but otherwise, this is a good start for a new social media platform.I am happy with the app so far. I wish that there were a few other features, like a favorites list or following tab so that I could switch back and forth. It is nice to be able to see people with similar interests and not be buried under bots and other hateful content. I am looking forward to future updates.There is no option to edit typo mistakes. I can't see where to add a video. In fact, I can't see where to add or post anything! Managed it once but don't know how? My icons seem to be missing! Using tablet and tried phone! Doesn't flow for me! I'll wait until it works properly before I invest too much time with it!The app is mostly fine (just Instagram's version of Twitter basically), but my main issue is how there's no way to turn off suggested posts so all the people I follow just get drowned in a bunch of threads from people I don't care about. The only way I've figured out how to get rid of them is by muting individual accounts, but that's way too much effort.pretty good idea as an extension of instagram, though lately theres this bug happening where nothings loading, i cant check my notifications, threads, or refresh my feed because 'an error occurred.' i'm not sure if im the only one experiencing this, but i hope it gets fixed quickly.I can't even use it properly. When I started to scroll or at least go to the other tabs it started to glitch and overlaps everything. Please fix this bug in the next update, I can't have the same experience like what my other friends does.It would be great if I were able to follow back people. Their \"spam trap\" has me as a false positive. I have submitted a support ticket 3 times & replied to their Thread about the problem several times, but no response. It's beyond frustrating and I'm almost ready to delete my account. If the problem gets fixed, I'll add more stars to my rating and change my review.what is wrong with having to press the speaker button if u want to upload a video huh?? the button is so tiny and most of the times users forgot to press that button... it's so stupid. Also, what is the purpose of following someone if we're gonna see random people's postings in our tl anyway?? Do not see where you are going with this honestly. Except for the smoothness of the UI, the UX is noticably worse than its' competitors.It is difficult to claim this is a \"stand alone\" application, as you need an Instagram account to access it. I do not use Instagram, and will probably not make any further attempt to use Threads either. First impression is... no impression at all.So far, so good! We need to be able to select what album we want to post a picture from. Right now, it doesn't give us that option. Also, when we reply to someone, it looks like it's all part of a thread instead of showing who we're replying to. Good start, little fixes here and there to make it work.First installed on my iPhone. Worked OK for a few days but then stopped showing notifications (just keeps saying try again). Refreshing doesn't help. Reinstalling doesn't help. Can't see comments on other posts. Tried the Android version and got exactly the same experience. Needs fixingI wish the photos/videos/reals not take up most of the page and makes it feels like another insta app ! Likes to be as close as Twitter copycat and let the priority rest on the text and people's posts mostly ! Wish there is an easier option to weed ourselves out of all those insta followers to follow us back hereGlitches out at random moments and you have to reload the app. Maybe once it progresses it'll stabilise. Urgent need of a translate option. Also the option of saving a thread would be nice. Also pining threads would be a step in the right direction.A terrible app that nobody needed. Nothing works here as it should. The UI is cluttered, with ads all over the pages and the reels integration is a nightmare. Talking about Privacy in context to Meta is a lost cause so I won't dwell much on that.I hope that it will have a dark mode feature, and also to have messages, so atleast we can send photo, video or vm there. I also hope that there could be a feature where you can also put video and photo stories. Lastly, it is too hard to switch account, so I hope you can do something with it. Thank you.App feels really great community has taken it very well. But I will have to give 2 starts cus this app don't like my best photograph I took I can't upload it every single time I try to upload that particular photo and upload fails i don't know why but please fix this. And if you devs want to checkout the file that's causing problem fell free to reach out, I would love to help and have a better Twitter alternative. Anyways good work on UI and stuff👍Still very buggy and not usable. Threads disapear. Bio gets synced with IG even after correcting this a couple times. Also not happy with all the permanence of it. Want more control over the data and privacy and data ownership.It was great at the beginning. Now, text threads are failing to post. I reinstalled the app, cleared the cache, changed the internet connection, and still have the same problem. Very disappointingIt was working perfectly until a few days ago and now I can't see anything in my activity tab, I can't post any new threads, I can't reply to any threads, I can only see the first post in a thread but none of the replies. I can still like threads and follow people and that's it. It's pretty much useless to have a social media app if I can't interact with any of my friends and followers. So disappointed. I really thought I had found a viable replacement for that trainwreck of a blue bird app.Problem1 : WHERE IS THE FOLLOWING TAB?? Problem2 : when I type in a text, and it lengthens , the text doesn't scroll up. Instead it gets covered underneath the on screen keyboard I'm typing on making it impossible for me to view the text while I'm typing it. Desired features : those 5 reaction from Facebook next to the standard Heart Like. And the no. Of views on a threads like Twitter has.It's just a Twitterised version of Instagram. Nothing more nothing else. And after a few weeks on its full of unwanted, unsavoury, bogus, fake-ish accounts that no one wanted and no one asked for. Since signing on all I've been doing is blocking and muting accounts. And the fact that it lacks so many features up until this day. Say what you will but I would rather stay in Twitter and Instagram.As soon as I got logged in on the app the entire thing is an unusable glitchy mess. I can't even see my screen, it's just pixels tearing in every direction. I'm guessing it hasn't even come close to being optimized for every device yet.Not only are serious security shortcomings prevalent, but placing \"Post\" & other interactive buttons at the bottom of the page means they are obscured by QWERTY & Google keypads on most smartphones. By comparison Twitter has all functions top of page.It's a new trending app ..it's good but I think that there is something you should fix it... like there is no conversation feature... sometimes it's lack when you scrolling ...in settings there should be set dark theme...if you have android version 10 or you have iOS 14 latest version then you can enable dark theme if you don't have you can't....but it is not so bad not so good...😃Threads, an Instagram app is a big no-no for me. The app is glitchy, slow, and boring. It's like a bad version of Twitter that nobody asked for. Why would I want to use another app to share text updates and join public conversations when I can already do that on Instagram or Twitter? The app also makes me nervous about my privacy and security, as it may share my data with third parties without telling me. Threads, an Instagram app is not worth my time or my phone's memory.Totally blank feed after following several top accounts. App just seems broken and doesn't do anything. No messages appear, no content. Searching for users works and following them works. But there are no feeds whatsoever after adding them.I just downloaded this tonight, but I already have a bunch of feelings. First, PLEASE give us a Following tab where all posts from people I follow show up in chronological order. If I want to find new people I'll use this crazy looking algorithm you have going, but in the meantime, I'm just hiding and blocking and not really engaging with the accounts I truly want to see. But so far, the app seems pretty user-friendly. When I actually see a post from someone I follow, of course.Not working! I uninstalled and installed it twice already but yet I can't upload photos. I mean I was able to the moment i installed it the first day but now just today it keeps saying failed to upload it's not a problem in my end i already do the basic troubleshooting on my phone too I restarted my phone restarted the network check other social apps aswell as yt and netflix everything is fine. Uploaded on ig & fb it's already uploaded but the one on thread it's still not since 4amBasic features work as expected. But it's about time we get a big update with more complex features like Edit Thread, Translate Thread, Ability to pin Threads, better Feed page, video player optimization and working hastagd. A trending page would be nice too. But current app is very good. 4/5.Why you guys don't fix it's bugs when I first time downloaded it,it's login went good and then when I scroll it things are getting overlaped, I was not able to see a word , I deleted it and downloaded it again but the same problem occurs all the time , fix it as soon as possibleI don't like that I can't edit an image before I post it. Also, when I want to post a picture, all of my gallery just spills out, no folders. It's stressful. Asides these, it's a great app Ps. Can we get dark mood🙂The app works fine, but you can't search topics by key phrases or hashtags which means the experience feels extremely curtated and walled off. The good parts about Twitter is that it made easy to discover new people to follow based on what they said as well as find authors and artists you wouldn't have found otherwise. Threads makes so you can't really do that. You can only follow people you already know exist and can't see art by people you don't follow or such.My review can improve over time, but it needs alot of improvement... It crashes alot and shows some annoying things on my screen. Alot of un delivered post keep appearing on my screen and it's annoying.. I wish I could share my screen so you can see itGreat version of a certain social media app. Please add the ability to switch accounts though! I have multiple Instagram accounts which I can easily switch between, therefore I have multiple Threads accounts which I would like to be able to switch between.I get severe ghosting issues from the app. It goes away when I open the task switcher then return to the app but happens again when I do anything as simple as scroll. I'm sure it's the app cause all other apps aside from this are fine. My phone is a Sony Experia XZ Premium G8141 running Android 9 Build 47.2.A.10.107This is very alternative for the blue bird app. It's actually fun and less toxic but there's some features that are still missing 1. Following Tab, as much as I like seeing people's threads, I wanna see the one I followed. 2. Hashtags, I mean if you wanna trend something you gotta use that. 3. Trending, I'm sorry I'm so used to looking at what's the trends ATM 4. Functional Search button. Not only the person you can search but pretty much everythingI really really liked this app . I downloaded it today and at evening it's starting to get glitching like whenever I'm scrolling the texts and pics are showing multiple times . I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it but the problem is still same , please fix it I hope to get a reply 😟Okay, I'll let you know the reason for my 3 stars. This app is okay, I just have a little problem with it. It has the same issue Instagram has. Its difficult to know those who are following you. On the followers list, they should be something like an icon that tells you someone is following back so one can easily unfollow those that aren't following back. Please make this update, it's really useful.After a few days of using the app here are the things I hope to be updated. 1. For you feed. I see random people more than people I actually follow. 2. Hashtags. I think this will help with reach and engage with people of your niche. 3. Dark Mode option. 4. Gallery tab. It's frustrating having to scroll down just to find an image I wanted to post. 5. Writing a reply. I cannot see anything I write because the keyboard blocks it while typing. 6. Algorithm. Everything is so random at the moment.It's good but not that good. Need more optimization and UI feels boring. What I want to see doesn't come in this app. What I want to see must come, like Instagram. Otherwise the app will become unusable for everyone and this app has mute, block, hide options not has \"Not interested in this video\" or threads\" hope you understand what I'm trying to say here.so far, so good. there are still missing features in the app like DMs, camera, etc. (also the algo seems way off) but one thing i find disappointing is the dark mode feature. i've navigated the app to find the button to turn it on or off and sadly there isn't one. my phone (samsung android 9) has a theme on so it cannot turn to dark mode and it doesn't make apps turn to dark mode. please, please, please add a dark mode feature as it may help other users like me browse more comfortably!The graphics are phenomenal. Please add trends based on location and a follow/unfollow button on each thread ellipse button options, and also add DMs. Otherwise, a game changer this one. Kudos to the team! PS don't sell the blue check!App is overall good but you have to click everytime on 🔇 to get the video sound. This is too much irritating. I want sound version like insta. There we didn't need everytime click on sound to play sound. Everything is good 👍 Solve my problem & I'll change my review to 5⭐. Thank You!its okay, hard to explore new content, there is no explore page yet. hard to find trending content/current content. the app is very bare bones at the moment but it does what it needs to. i would like to see trending content/ news content, and a way to explore new content without scrolling past new posts from accounts i currently follow on the home pageI guess it's too early for this app to be released cuz it has a lot of issues and missing important features like: - the design is so random literally copy of Instagram with some Twitter things - profile page is so boring it doesn't even have header - how the heck there is no dark theme?? - ain't no way this app doesn't have direct messages - not even hashtags - the setting option are so little - too slow to share post or delete it - no gifs - recommending random people post not interested toPublicity highly misleading. Should be a stand-alone app but instead it's only available tied to your Instagram account. If it WERE stand-alone, I would most probably use it - the world needs an alternative to Twitter... AND to Instagram (even though they're both Meta). Uninstalled.The app so far looks good, but the one issue I have is that when I try to upload a photo, the app crashes. There are a lot features that the app needs at the moment that people mentioned (also a web version would good since I'm at my computer a lot), but it feels rushed.Good Start, but intermittent bugs. Today, as I was following people back, it would periodically start flashing this box that said, \"Something went wrong, try again,\" that box would vanish & then reappear like a strobe with no way to exit, other than force stopping the app. Then, once restarted, all the people I'd just followed would just show as new requests, even though I'd just followed them? Frustrating! These glitches all started since the update yesterdayDecent app with the most basic of microblogging functionality. Only big due to the brand name - had this been any startup, this would have been dead in the water. Lacks basic functionality such as a web interface and user sign-ups without having to tie an Instagram account. Block feature is also not working as you can still see the posts of a blocker user.Like most people are saying, the app is decent. It does need more features. You can't save photos or videos from your feed. It also needs a view media only mode. I believe that eventually everybody will migrate from Twitter over to this app, once the updates & new features come in.It's pretty bare as an app, but that also means you can only add-on features at this point, which is exciting. There's needs to be an easier way to go from Instagram to Threads. Having two apps is a bit much. It would be cool if they could both live in the same spaceA welcome option to get away from Twitter, but migration, though painless, comes without a few much needed aspects. Searching by keywords for posts about a subject can't be done. No option to see trending subjects either. And the app does not always keep its last position, resulting sometimes in restarting from the very beginning of your feed. The recent update fixed the jerky scrolling; everything else is pending more updates!I don't really see the appeal of this. Yeah it's a rival to twitter and whatnot but for now, it doesn't look too promising. Boring interface, no option for what's shown in our feed, no explore or trending page, even no hashtags. The moderation system works though, and the filters are good unlike twitter where it's way less moderated there. But overall twitter is still a better app in my opinion.I have been experiencing frequent crashes when trying to load replies and sometimes I don't see response from the like button. This app has great potential, right now what I'm looking for in the next update is a translate button.The app is glitching very much due to heavy amount of traffic. The written articles and captions are penetrating all over the tabs and screen. Couldn't perform specific tasks so please fix these issues as soon as possible.First Impression of the app is good, but it would been better if there was a multi account login feature like in Insta and if it was connected with Insta with a user name instead of showing a number in the profile. And it will be better there will be option to like in Insta, by double taping.There are many issues, first I can't edit my profile, it gives me error when pressing done button, second link to insta is not that great as pressing cancel on following on threads unfollowed people on insta, third I selected only few acc to follow from insta instead of every one on insta, but it's showing everyone following on insta as following on threads!The posts in here are the most mundane, vapid junk I've ever seen. It seriously feels as if AI is making all the posts. On top of that there's no way to refresh the main (and only!!) Feed with new content. You are stuck with the same feed throughout the day, which only incrementally gets new content added to it as the day goes on.Worst experience. Trying to upload the post since yesterday, 'Thread failed to upload' message pops up every time. Really frustrating. Did all the thing like , cleared cache, OS update n all. Still pathetic experience. These kind of things wasn't expected from a Meta product.Wish I'd done more research before downloading this app. Feed is filled with posts from people I don't follow and it's impossible to find posts from people I do. Now I can't delete it or Meta will also delete my Instagram account so that's how they trap you into keeping it. Turning off all notifications on this app and just won't use it since it's junk. Wish there was an option for zero stars!Want to like it so bad but it's not good. You can't search for anything but other accounts. You can't type in any words in the search bar and find other people talking about the same thing. Not trending topics. It's only a one timeline of people that threads suggests to you and its usually a celebrity or an influencer. The app isn't good.I got regretted when I created an account at this trash app. Also it stopped working just because I'm in the country that the app is not available. I used VPN to access and after 2-3 days, the posts stopped showing and says \"something went wrong, try again\" and I can't post as well, and even If I want to deactivate my account it says \"failed to deactivate\". What's wrong with this trashy app. There is Twitter and is enough, there is no need for creating a clone trash with same idea as Twitter.App crashes when attaching an image. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S9 and I've seen others even on iPhone report this issue but no official acknowledgement of it seems to have released. I hope they fix this pretty quickly because it's a bit annoying.For now I give it 2 stars since the app interface just acting weirdly. Looks like the screen is gllitching all the time whenever I tried to scroll. Maybe because it's quite new app. Hopefully it got fixed soon. It's annoying to not be able to do anything.Currently there is not any web interface option for computers, which is a HUGE issue for me (as well as for many others in my industry). I only access the competition (Twitter) via web browsers on my computer. I follow businesses and services in my industry during work (multi monitors in common place in my industry). No interest in following from my phone's little 6.8\" screen. Thanks for readingSuch a waste! I don't think we need Threads. It has absolutely nothing to offer. Instagram is more than enough. It's just a weaker version of an ordinary social media app. Want to delete my account but that will instantly delete my Instagram account too. That's very bad and cheap tactics. I'm very disappointed. Shall delete my Instagram too.It's interesting so far, but a lot of us use desktop way more than mobile apps. It took a long time for Instagram to figure that out, but they finally gave a half-assed desktop version. Threads ought to do the same. Maybe even full-assed. And FB should break the moratorium on parsing Threads links when sharing our profiles. Can't we all get along??Threads is a fantastic blend of Twitter's essence and Instagram's seamless connectivity. With an emphasis on clean interface, it's a convenient way to stay connected with Instagram followers. If you're an Instagram enthusiast, Threads is definitely worth exploring.Can't post photos, app crashes every time. Tried all the workarounds found on line, no joy! It is a cluster mess to read, just random posts from random people with few of the people I am following. This needs a lot work.It kept crashing, especially when writing a new thread. I was repeatedly put off because of this and closed the app entirely. Hopefully it's fixed in a future update, I'll update my review once this app stops crashing.I found some issues while scrolling the screen. I am using Android 9 , but when I scroll the screen it flickers or freezes on the same screen. I kindly request the Threads Team to solve this issue... Otherwise I like the app so much✔️...I cannot get this app to send notifications and I cannot get rid of Twitter until it does. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Logged out/logged in. Played with notification settings in app and in phone settings. Turned off battery optimization for app. No notifications.Features requests & bugs (so far) : - notification scrolling is very limited - only full gallery is available when looking for a file to attach - no ability to just switch accounts (you have to log out every time) - no dark mode (please for the love of my retinas!)It's decent thus far, it definitely needs a translate thread feature, you can't search keywords and there's no tags to find specific things, so there's no real way to 'grow' except for finding your friends on the app. You can post pictures and videos, quote threads and repost threads. There's no DM system, which is fair enough. I do expect the app to get better in coming updates, but for now it's kind of lacking.When I set my phone to dark mode the app starts glitching as I scroll, all the content keeps collapsing on top each other and it's unreadable but it works smoothly on light mode. Apparently I'm not the only one who has this issue.While uploading photos, it keeps getting kicked out of the app, while uploading photos, it shows that the photos are not coming in the form of files or positions, all of them come together, so many problems are faced.Not bad app, it does have less features than twitter (like polls and desktop site), but more stuff is probably going to be added one day. I'm just happy that people can (kinda) see my threads without having to pay a subscription. Though, I have a few annoyances. Like paid verification. That's Twitter's thing. I get that it has the ID stuff but still, can you at least make it where if you have alot of followers you can get verified without the fee??It's a good app for spending some of your time without losing the track of time and waste more time like in Instagram and YouTube. It is starting so it is not perfect I think it should have reel s and all plus it should have personalized content because a lot of content I see on thread I don't even care about so they could improve this with updates. It is smooth and not laggy like Twitter with which it is competing. But privacy is a problem because meta is not good privacyOnly one account? So much for businesses being able to use it. It's 2023, you would think that this feature would be one of the first things added. Frustrating to say the least and am really not interested in trying this app anymore now that I realized that I can't have my business/fan pages on here and easily switch between them like Facebook/Instagram/YouTube/Twitter all have.It was good at first but when I came on the app today it kept on crashing even when I cleared its cache. Please fix it. Edit: It seems like my problem has been fixed for now. As I said, the app is great, missing some features like search but other than that it's pretty good.Looks very clumsy. Material design sucks. While trying to upload the media, unable to go to a specific folder in gallery app in Android. But works well in iOS. And no option to save images like Twitter. Why that specific option is not copied from Twitter?I think the Threads app is not bad for a starting point, although it does tend to crash frequently in the background, but that could be attributed to its early development stage. I believe it will have impressive progress in the future.It's a good start, but it could be better. Please fix how the bell notifications work. They don't really notify me when a person uploads. And please add hastags and a better way to see posts from people I follow. I barely see anything from people I follow. Also add a way to see reposts and a person's posts separately on their account. It looks kinda cluttered-More than half the images make the app crash. -Some of the images that don't make the app crash seem to upload initially but then fails to upload -Only some images can be uploaded others (both jpeg and similar size) make the app crash. -Being able to choose folders in the device to share media files would be good instead of the most recent pictures. -Switch the account function would be useful, currentlyIt's only just launched so I think we should give it a chance to grow but there's virtually no customization. You can't limit your feed to only accounts you follow and you can't create or filter your own feed via hashtags or keywords. This makes for a very bland and homogenized platform. The feed feels disorganized and strewn together with things I don't care about and don't find interesting. I would much prefer something that could be configured and adjusted to my own tastes.Worst experience 😭😔, i have installed threads just now and its being really like threads 😞, the app has some bugs to be fixed. As i opened the app i the posts weren't clear and were over lapping each other, creating a mess on my screen. It needs to be fixed as early as possible.The thread app is good app as I heard from my friends.but when I installed and opened the app,it's is something coming like it's having a bug on that.i think meta can rectify that types of errors and not only for me,i saw many of the review that they are also having some bug while opening it, hence meta want to rectify as soon as possible.Quick, yes. I will need to be able to curate my feed at some point, but this initial flood of content is a goldmine for businesses! Threads Links from other apps (WhatsApp) don't open to the app. Rather, they open in Chrome! Loss of traffic.The app is very interesting and I personally really like it. I hope that more new features will be added in the future. Similarly, it would be better if there was a facility to save posts and apply hashtags.I also really like the colors used for the app. Already this application has exceeded a large number of users. So, I believe that in the future this will be a very secure, reliable, indispensable application for people.It's Good but I feel like it's going to need a little more to compete with Twitter. For example This app also needs a trending page similar to Twitter. You could also include something else that is original. I feel like it could have a little bit more to it. I know it just came out a couple days ago, but there needs to be something added if this is going to keep the hype up around the app.It's clearly rolled out in a haste, but I appreciate the people who worked on this app. There is no method to add more than one profiles which we can toggle between on Instagram. So if we have 2 profiles on Instagram u can only use one. Hope this will be resolved soon.So far so good. Seems to be working out some bugs, I keep getting kick out the app whenever I try to respond to comments. My phone also provided a pop-up stating that it has bugs. So I'm hoping that works itself out bc I really do enjoy it.Best and worst Twitter replacement. Interface is very fluid, intuitive and esthetically pleasing, but it keeps crashing frequently. Also, this is an extention of Meta's attempt at monopoly.Clean and Nice UI . I like it so far , but there are some points need to be fixed . 1- i follow Arabic and English content in my account, but the alignment is bad , if put the app language is English, the Arabic content will be a chaos and vice versa . 2- waiting for the follow and hashtags features, I'm ready to give it 5 stars after these points fixed .i think the app is a great start! one of the things that will be required in order to give space to fan accounts though is to have us be able to easily switch accounts in Threads. You can only sign in/sign out every time - we can't do it smoothly.3 stars for now. It may go up or down depending on future updates. I love that it's, so far, ad free, that it's easy to use and not as toxic as twitter(although I fully expect that to change). As simple as twitter. Imo, it needs an option to only see posts from those you follow, also a topic or group section where we can join current trending topics or interests we have, which is also a great way to follow others and pick up followers who are like-minded.I like it so far. The only feature I need is the ability to select photos from different albums in my phone instead of showing all photos in reverse chronological order.My honest review, is that how it is and the idea they have of the app is perfect, following threads and about conversation. I don't think it needs DMs, and Livestream. ITS FOR CONVERSATION AND SHARING IDEAS ONLY. EASY PEACY. Cause what's the point of adding more things, it's gonna get like twitter in the future or later on instagram. I mean, there are already apps for that, let's separate things. I do agree that it could have an option of seeing feed from everyone and another of followers.Love the app ... One thing I would like is the volume on the videos being easier to select as on .. and once it's on for one, stays on for all until I turn it off. Also, I know they have more to come like better search features. Oh, and if I could see more of who I follow on my feed, rather than your 'suggestions' ... That would be nice 👍 If you are Threads development reading this, I'm using Android,... Oh and GIFs. I have to use an app, save them and post them rather th. The keyboard on my 📱I'm grateful that someone has created an alternative to the mess that Twitter has become, and Threads is looking promising. It's early days yet, so I expect changes, but the App desperately needs the ability to show Threads from people I subscribe to, and in chronological order of their posts. The interface is clear-ish but definitely needs work. No ads yet! Unfortunately, I've been followed by 'Sexy Susan' who has zero followers and a risque profile pic so I think the bots are active already.Any time I scroll it blasts me with visual bugs out the walls to the point where it is blatantly unusable. The entire screen flashes, text leaves constant flashing after images when I scroll, changing tabs leaves a massive collage of broken symbols and images.Needs a lot of work. Most of the time I can't see threads nor notifications, I always get a something went wrong message. The scroll is too slow. No indication if someone is following you or not.Another phenomenal socmed platform by Meta! I just downloaded this yesterday and I am already comfortable with using it. The user interface is super easy to learn and get used to. Plus, the features are superb. You can literally upload Threads in one click. Furthermore, you can also reply to other people's post with text, image, and other interactions. They're all visible in one place, unlike to the other confusing and dizzying platform called Twitter. <3 LOLIt's a great app and it's really easy to navigate but there's still a lot to be done.. Add a Message Button, Add Tags in Search, Add in settings where one can disable or enable Public Replies, that should be private. ThanksAs soon as got logged in on the app the entire thing is an unusable glitchy mess. I can't even see my screen, it's just pixels tearing in every direction. I'm guessing it hasn't even come close to being optimized for every device yet.I would really like it more if I could curate my feed. Facebook, insta, tumblr, reddit, are all positive experiences because I am able to customize my feed experience to my interests. I don't necessarily mind seeing things I didn't intentionally follow, but it should allow me to choose. I'm also really not interested in the inanity of those with massive followings. I much prefer actual conversations with people who aren't here To Produce Content.It's a new app, and I believe it still needs improvement. While typing, the keyboard covers the text, which makes it hard to see what someone is typing. Also, I think it make a lot of sense of I can see people that follows me on their profile.Honestly, it really does feel like Twitter, but less cursed. I've seen no real problems with it so far. One thing I think would be cool is instead of showing the little character at the bottom right of the screen to view our profile, it should be our profile picture. Not nitpicking, I just think that'd be a cool idea. Also being able to edit our comments and stuff would be cool as well. Still an amazing app, five stars well earned thus far.There is no editing tools. It is not possible to select some other folders while posting images, it is fixed to Gallery. Not clear view of threads. Maybe all later will come with some price on them :)))I genuinely like the Threads app. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of some features i feel the app needs. Trending topics should have been there from the premiere. Also DMs, even if it's a button that links us to Instagram DM to complete the conversation. The app could also use the Spaces function. Overall, Threads is amazing.Here's my honest review: It's not a bad app, but there could be more features alike that could make the whole app more fun to use. Much like how Instagram allows you to switch accounts, maybe Threads could use the same feature. The only method to switching is by logging out currently. What I liked the most was the dark theme that it came with upon opening the app. Easy to get used to.Not a very stable application as of me typing, for example when I tag someone or type too much on my device, it crashes. A recommendation for the application is to have an option to pin our threads and the option to edit our threads. It will increase user experience.Evidently a rushed app to fill the gap left by twitter but it honestly does provide a better experience, if somewhat barenones. All it needs is a few feed options and that's kinda it. It shouldn't strive to do everything but instead focus in on text based contentGreetings and blessings to the developer team the app is really good and the ideology is great some people might not love it but it's good. But ... I'm repeatedly facing an issue of not being able to login on insta and threads at the same time so i cannot repost my threads post on insta. This may be a bug but it's a big one and pretty much capable of irritating the user. I'd love if you fixed it.This app is excellent... But dear Meta, I'm having problem in app whenever I just open the app it opens but when is scroll down then it's start shaking and fluctuating.. I just uninstalled and restarted my phone but this problem is still same... So Dear Meta Cooperation.. Please give some solution for this problem 🙂 and if you want proof then give me your number, email or something to send you the actual problem's screen shotThe interface looks simple and easy to use. But what I really hate is all the posts from whom-I-dont-even-know show up on my home page and I don't seem to find the way to get rid of them all. This is so annoying and the home page is literally useless for me. Please fix that.All you 1stars, give it time. It's a fresh app that isn't trying to do it all. Lead devs interact with users and have explained what's to come. It's fine if you want the X Corp app where every feature breaks on launch but much of what you want is coming - personalized TL, search, etc. Don't get me wrong Meta is sinister but they know how to build an app.I am enjoying using threads. I only wish I could tailor the post that appear on my homescreen to be more about what I like. Also, wish I could schedule or save posts I'm making for later. Also, I think it would be cool if you could try to make some widgets to be used on the homescreen of phones. Currently not having any luck of being noticed at all on the platform. Please make it easier somehow for smaller threads users to get noticed.App seems cool. But I would like to search topics and see more of the people I'm following. Also sometimes when I click on my following list, I get a \" Sorry Couldn't complete request, try again later\" Can you fix that.It works fine as a twitter substitute so far, but every time I try to upload images in my replies, I keep getting error messages saying that my post failed to upload. Yes, I cleared my cache and tried again. The problem still persists.Im here to giving feedback 1. Cant scroll down if trying to write too much, the writing even being unseen with keyboard mode on. 2. Cant double tap on words to make block on words. 3. The photo cant cropped after you insert on thread. 4. Why limitation still counting words even after threads. Thats all, fix that, ill back to twitterI see the HUGE potential in this App. Possible areas of improvement: 1. Hashtags? Easier to follow stuff. 2. Sync to Insta account. What I mean is that if I want to post something on Insta, it can automatically post the same thing on Threads (like the insta/Facebook sync) 3. Desktop version. I post some of my insta things from my laptop. PLEASE do the same for Threads. \"Moving to Threads cause Twitter is dead.\"Add a better search engine. Add hashtags. Add a better way to share from the gallery albums..instead of one picture at a time. Add ability to customize profile pages with different colors and fonts. Just a few suggestions that would really help.Good interface but function not as good as twitter. I have a few suggestions: 1. Dark mode option. 2. Can change username even if linked to Instagram. 3. \"Back\" button should close the app directly. Why scroll back all the way to the top before closing? I wouldn't be able to continue where I left off, it's inconvenient. 4. What's the point of \"following\" if my timeline is full of people I don't follow? A few suggestions here and there is cool, but it's too much now it isn't fun anymore.it's a great start but still there's a bug, once you delete your post, the \"reply\" notification still there like living a mark and this app makes me feel touch move you are not allowed to make mistake. hope this can be help and make it more clean/smooth.Makes me sign up for an Instagram account, but doesn't give the option within the app. Then it tells me my IP address is an open proxy, tells me check their help, which has nothing about it. Like I'm jumping through hoops so they can steal all my data.Too much bugs. Please fix some bugs first. For example, when I click the delete button for fixing the word/line, all the other words will mix/collide and create some never ever known word.For some reason, a day after I used this app, a pop-up message says, 'You've been logged out of %1$s. The account owner may have changed the password.' It keeps popping up, and the app keeps closing. Please fix this issue.Threads features a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. The app's design is minimalistic, placing the focus on conversations and ensuring a distraction-free experience. From the moment I started using Threads, I found it effortless to locate and engage in conversations.A great app given the fact it's only been a few days since it launched but there are obviously some flaws into it. For example, when I want to post a picture, it often kicks me out of the app and takes hours for it to allow me to post that picture. I also usually can't see who just started following me, shows me my followers fine at first but once I surpass 50-ish followers, I stop receiving notifications and I can no longer see the usernames of those who follow me.Loads of improvements can happen. Picture attachments have only \"Gallery\" and do not support folders. I have a load of trash on my Home feed from random users I don't follow. Needs a followers/for you separation in that case. Also, dark mode.I had to delete my account and delete the app and start over. After ONE DAY, 2 posts and 7 likes, IT IS FAILING TO POST AGAIN!!! No warning. Please fix this!!! I am on a Samsung tablet and for the past few days my posts and quoted posts fail to upload. I need help and sending a message to @zuck and @meta does not go through, because all my posts are failing. I deleted and reinstalled this app, to no avail. It seems I can repost only.I wish there was an option to only see threads from people you follow (Right now it's like the \"For You\" page on Twitter when it needs the \"Following\" option), and the ability to sort chronologically! If those two things changed, this would absolutely be a 5* app&beat Twitter by a mile. Right now, it's pretty \"meh\". Lots of room for improvement though!The app would have been cool if it was working properly and doesn't look like it glicthes. Like I can't read threads and look at photos, whenever I scroll the previous thread will be on the one I'm reading. So please fix it...Solid day 1 experience. Only a few bugs in that the search feature stopped working once or twice and there are some features that would be nice that are coming out soon (no release date, they do have it confirmed on the list of stuff coming though).For an app that just launched a few days ago, it's honestly pretty good!! However, there are a few things I'd like to see improved & made: hashtags, folder to save threads, draft notes.Firstly, I want to express my appreciation for the overall concept of Threads. It provides a convenient and private platform for sharing updates, photos, and videos with close friends. However, the integration of the Reels feature within the app has caused some inconvenience and cluttered the user experience.Separating the Reels section within the app would greatly enhance the user experience. It would allow for improved focus, easier navigation, enhanced privacy, and a streamlined interface1. Although no ads in threads, but too much algorithmic content on feed which I don't really like. 2. You have to login with your Instagram account. You cannot create new account by email or phone number. 3. Once you created threads account you cannot delete it. If you want to delete, then you have to delete your Instagram account as well because threads account is interlinked with Instagram. 4. There is nothing new UI & UX. Looks like Twitter. Almost same UI. 5. No Chat option. No HashtagThe home page needs a huge adjustment. There's no logic to the content I'm seeing. There needs to be a way to cater what you're seeing. I only want to see the people I follow, that's why I follow them. It's a mess. Additionally, there's essentially no data privacy, so be weary. Also....you can't delete your account? What a misstep.Yes, it's a new app. But Meta is not exactly an indie developer! There is literally no reason to be flooding us with Rando Accounts. That should have been basic functionality from Day 1. But like Instagram, seems Threads just wants to push random posts on us whether we like it or not. Until basic functions are in, I'll be sticking with Twitter.\"Something went wrong please try again\". Get this message all the time. Can't see replies, my profile and many other features. This message just pops up all the time. Also people I follow don't show up at the top of my feed. I get random recommendations at top. Back to Twitter until sorted.You cannot delete it unless you delete your instagram account too. The deep integration with instagram is perverse. It could have been a standalone app that does not require you to plug in into the metaverse by force but I guess that was asking too much.If there was less random stuff on feed, it would be a lot better, or if there was some way to organize it where you have a following feed and a for you feed. There's just too much random stuff.Its wonderful it's just needs a little bit more improvement, like multiple pictures the second time you post because I posted multiple pictures the first time and now I'm unable to post more pictures including just one but I am able to upload videos which I think is weird I am also able to make regular posts with words onlyThreads is a fantastic new app that enhances the Instagram experience and revolutionizes private messaging. It seamlessly integrates with Instagram, allowing users to stay connected with their closest friends and share moments in a more intimate and personalized way. The app's interface is sleek, intuitive, and easy to navigate User Shree_MorbekarPLEASE make it so you can separate your followers from the suggested algorithm stuff, it's so hard to find the content i ACTUALLY want to to see. this would be the first thing that should be updated/added. I don't like using it that much because of thatFirst and foremost, the user interface of Threads is beautifully designed and user-friendly. Navigating through the app is a breeze, with intuitive controls and a clean layout that makes it easy to find what you're looking for. The app's attention to detail in terms of aesthetics is commendable, and it truly enhances the overall user experienceI am experiencing a problem with video sounds. If the audio is muted video plays fine. When I turn the audio on, video stops playing. Both in feed and when I click on video and open it, it happens.All the things are quite well but where the edit button i the app? On starting the the app, it's previous refreshes remains on display. But after shaking for report, it becomes normal, no lag, no glitch.! What's the matter?Right now. This app sucks. No hashtags, no way of searching keywords. The only thing you can search is usernames. Your feed is loaded with a bunch of stuff you don't want to see. The app has potential but they rushed the launch. I'll give them a couple weeks to add some more features but right now there is no benefit for general users.App keeps crashing. If i scroll for a while or while writing a thread, it crashes. If i am responding to a thread which has a vertical photo/video, i cannot see what i am typing. It seems as if interns have made this app.Search function only searches accounts, not posts or keywords. Useless. The timeline is all influencers, sports, and celebrity accounts w/ high traffic. I barely see the posts from accounts I'm following! After muting unwanted accounts my timeline has not changed in the last 12 hours and I can only continuously scroll thru the same handful of posts from yesterday. No option to view posts I've liked or bookmark things to revisit later. I know it's early days but these are critical features.Why can't my name be name (not app nickname or whatever) be different than the one on my Instagram account. I use these apps for different reasons. What's even the point of this if it's just the same stuff as Instagram? Also I want to be able to view threads in chronological order and have the app save my spot when I leave it and come back. I don't want to be a slave to your mediocre algorithm.The potential for a good app is there, but it's not good yet. Most notably, the front page is filled almost exclusively with people you don't follow. App is literally unusable until a following-only feed is implemented.Not bad works great on my fold 4, but when switching between the displays, it asks to restart the app. It should handel multiple screens better than this. Still, it's better than Elon's crapwitter!Very weird and bad. My feed is full of randoms who confuse me and I don't care about anything they ever want to post. Lack most basic features like DMs and requires insane amount of private data. Also needs Instagram account and can't be removed without removing both accounts.It is a wonderful app. But I think tbey can still do better concerning picture uploading. Like I have to scroll through thousands of pictures to find the one I want to upload. It can be very frustrating.It has a constant visual bug on my device where the app's background gets smeared with whatever content is being displayed on the foreground, and it doesn't refresh back to black. ROG 2, Android 9Ik this is just the first day of its launch but I don't really like the formate here. I feel like I'm stuck in the same place that feels sofficating on the main page, and I can't see much of the content that I've followed and had to refollow the creators again. Congrats on the launched of the app, but hopefully this will change soon so the app will be much better than how it is now.A very lonely app if you don't already have several instagram followers. I would also appreciate a photo album option as I have 8000 photos on my phone and can't scroll through them all. I get that it's brand new but it seems very unfinished.I wish there is a chat option in threads too, so that we are able to share threads with one another on the same platform instead of copying the link and sharing it on instagram. Also, it would be better if we are able to download the video or the picture directly. I personally feel that maybe threads should be a part of instagram instead of being a complete seperate app.. Just like how reels are a part, threads should also be a part of instagram. That would be nice and easier.It has minimal UI and a typical user flow. There is a bug, though. When I try to upload images in the following thread, it shuts. I tried removing from recents, reinstalled, but stayed the same.Not bad for an initial launch. Looking forward to future versions, and hopefully a web interface that allows posting. Needs a lot of work, but will probably exceed Twitter's features and eventually popularity.This Applications interface is shuttering when I use to refresh the page and also it don't responded as I can expect. I thing it needs to improve their interfacen !! Yes I was very excited to use this app but it didn't work in my phone. Is it running fine with your device ?Lot of space to improve. Would love to have a much more advanced options to post a thread (text styling etc.), and a view that seperate people you follow and fyp. Need the save image and video button. Need the time mark in video player. Just experienced crashing when I go beyond a reply to a reply in a thread, hope yall will fix that ASAP. Need save button, hashtags and embed. For messages just link insta... Please don't seperate it. Need the option to choose what we see from a person we follow.Writing after day 1, it's about as smooth a launch as it could've hoped for. I am however having a problem where if I search for users too much (as one looking for accounts to follow will do), the search breaks and doesn't fix itself. I'm not sure whether this is a bug or a rate limit. It fixed after reinstallation but only once. I hope and expect more features will be added to the app in short order, too. E.g. DMs, customized account lists, Web version. Default home feed should be different.I feel like there's room for more features. Like the dark and light mode. One should be able to save pictures and also choose whether to auto play videos or notThreads needs a search feature for content. The search bar only searches for accounts. People should be able to use the search bar to find thread topics. If you want to see what's being said about a show or person, you should be able to search keywords to pull content related to your search. The app feels unusable without that simple feature.There's no option to disable Reels or videos autoplay on the app. This is the major reason why I don't use Instagram, its parent app. Too many unnecessary Reels or videos will consume a lot of data. I thought this would be different from Instagram, but it's all the same. I hate the autoplay.It's more like Facebook, in my opinion, but it doesn't allow for hashtags or topic searches. I prefer Twitter, most def. I want to delete it, but the app does not allow account deletion without also deleting my Instagram. Not happy with the app at all, really.Cool interface. Nice idea. However, I'm unable to browse different locations in my phone to add a photo or video to my post. This is significant issue and a turn offSorry only two stars however gotta admit the app has huge potential but you need to do two things, first get rid of the annoying celebrities and influencers and brands that i don't follow nor any of the people on my following list interacted with from my timeline, second you need to disconnect the app from instagram or at least make the link between the two optional.The size of the application is huge. There is also no data saving mode with it, We can't stop autoplay videos. Get the lite version of this application as soon as possible.I like it, but the content us not sorted chronologically, so I keep seeing posts from two days ago mixed with more recent posts. Also, lots of post from corporations, celebrities and influencers keep being shown in the timeline (if we can call it like that), so I spend all my time muting and blocking, because those marketing agency contents are annoying to see.I am a big fan of this application. I've been getting tired of all the changes Elon has done to twitter. There is still a very steep growth curve, but im very excited. There are two features that I feel like would be really helpful to improve user experience. 1) as im writing my threads, if I exceed the number of threads my screen allows, I am unable to scroll down to see what im writing as my keyboard is blocking the view, and threads doesn't allow to scroll down. 2) threads scheduler!Good start, needs a lot of work. It is a good start but is missing basic features like; DMs, following feed, dark mode. It is also a bit slow to load.When I log into Threads, I automatically log out from Instagram and vice versa. There is no option to see posts only from accounts I follow. There is no option for posts that I am NOT INTERESTED in. It is new, and people like new things, but let me just say it, there is a huge need for improvement.Keeps closing when typing. I'm using a Huawei P30 and it just closes when typing, more often when typing @ then a name but it's mega frustrating. I'm giving it a 3 because of this. Otherwise it's a fantastic new app and the absence of DMs is an absolute winner and game changer.The amount of data this app requires from users is absurd. And the fact that you can't delete your threads account without deleting your instagram is horrible! The app itself is mainly text. If you're joining as a Twitter alternative, don't bother. You can't even search posts. There are no hashtags. I already want to delete threads just because of the extreme data mining. Europe has blocked it for those exact reasons.Lacks a lot of features so here's some feedback: Add a trending page in there. Make it so that the followers and following can be accessed separately, like on IG. Allow people to have different usernames from their IG handles. When there's a bunch of images, show them in a collage instead of showing one big image and then scrolling to the others like in IG. Also, let people zoom into pics without the images resizing themselves automatically. Don't compress images. Make it different from IG.Draining the battery and the app is missing a lot of features. They force you to use Instagram account for using the app. If I want to delete the account for Threads then I have to delete my Instagram account too. Please read details of the app it may collect before U download because they collect too much sensitive informations like financial and health also others details. The app working poorly because it keeps crashing when trying to post or comment and login push notification keep lagging.This app would've been a better version of Twitter but if one wants to delete the account, they need to delete their Instagram too. This is the worst implemention a company could have brought. Deactivating does not include your Instagram but still, you should be able to delete your account without deleting Instagram! At least this information needs to be in the registiration page OR the description of the app.Great app with lots of potential. The app's social features are also fantastic. I can connect with friends who are also using Thread's, create groups, and even send direct invites to plan lunch dates. It's a great way to stay connected and coordinate lunch outings with ease.One thing this app is good and it's on time where we'll get to see latest things more than Twitter. But one thing keeps me annoyed is that whenever I'm scrolling and a video pops out I always have to unmute and next video comes I still have to unmute like I just can't stop doing that. So that's the only problem I'm facing with this app so if that's fixed by next update I'm sure I'm gonna put 5 stars on thatEverything else is OK , but When you go to gallery you have no option for going to your photo albums. If I have 500 photos in my gallery I have to scroll through every photo in my gallery to get the particular one. I think there should be an option for getting access to your photo albums in attachment.I'm still learning why I need the app & how I can make it work for me... Haven't found my identity yet... However... Sometimes while leaving a thread of my own or commenting on someone else', I'll be randomly kicked out, as if I touched my minimize button, (which I haven't) & it's gone out of the post I was in & cleared what I typed. Most times I would loose the post completely... You can imagine how frustrating this is! 10 July, I had to re-type my own thread 4 times, as I kept being kicked outI want my video muted for private reasons and i hope insta/meta devs can make it slightly bigger so that i avoid pressing the video when pressing the unmute button, i hate it when it happens becoz the video gets enlarge, i like the auto play feature while scrolling, the mute/unmute button is just my problem. So i rate it 4/5, so far so good it feels like a new home, a new space to breath, new people to meet, internet feels new again. Thank you Instagram! Thank you Meta!I am not impressed. The app should have been separated from IG. Any restriction on one should never have to affect the other. Again, the whole idea of not having access to one's followers list at some point is annoying. Can we have a tab to mass-unfollow everyone who isn't following back. I need my time line to be filled with contents I choose to see from followers. It crashes a lot too.Definitely still enjoying this low stress and low drama experience on day 2. It has room to grow and improve, and a rollout of new features will help to retain users, but for something in its infancy, it's pretty great.It's okay. But I hope it has an option to simply switch account. Just like in IG where I can just double tap the profile icon then it switches. In threads, I need to logout first then switch account which is quite frustrating.I like the app, however there are some glitches and recommendations I have. For one, the reply function seems to be finicky, it on occasion force shuts down the app when I am trying to reply to a post (a thread?). Another recommendation is discoverability, I would love a tab where you can discover new people and what they're saying. Like a community or discover page, also a trending tab with news and the sorts would boost engagement.hope we can change the name/username without syncing on Instagram. unless there are reasons behind it, then it's fine. also, my profile picture doesn't show up for some reason.Great app... but some things need fixing. The app crashes anytime I try to upload a photo, probably 10mb or higher. Plus, the quite disorganised feed. Asides that great app and competition for TwitterI like the simplicity and the focus on conversation. Plus, no ads yet, which is why I gets 5 stars. There's no clear organization of threads. I like the panorama photo presentation, too, it's slick. Threads can't take credit for the quality of users, but I'm rather enjoying the pleasant and kind people I see on there.Nice app. But when I try to load a picture on my Threads draft, the app shuts down. I mean, it just closes 🤷‍♀️ Tried like another 20 times, but once I select a picture and click done, app closes. That's scary because I've lost hardwritten drafts because of that.I used to be a user few months ago and this was just like messenger. When I downloaded this again today, I hoped they would've saved the messaging option. It's a good app for the rivalry but I didn't expect them to completely remove the originality of the app. I hope the future updates of this app will consist a mixture of the old threads and the new one so we can DM the people along w this new sick update. Until then, I'll be using old version of this app just for my DMs lol.While typing out a post or reply the app force closes with no error message. And when it does this it has no temporary memory to start where you left off. Rather frusting if you plan on posting rather than scrollingNot too bad so far it feels a little barren in comparison to some other websites and apps but it has potential The quality control and filtering need some work And i'd like more control over the timeline of stuff I see but it's a startThreads is an amazing app for staying connected with your close friends on Instagram. You can share photos, videos, messages, and stories with your chosen group of people in a fast and fun way. You can also customize your camera with shortcuts and create your own status to let your friends know what you’re up to. Threads is the best app for keeping in touch with your besties.Threads is a useless trash app. They could have made the app completely separate from instagram, but nope. That's not complicated enough for them. I can't log into my account right now on either app.I don't know if this is a common issue, but I can't even scroll the app. It acts like there is a crash in the app. Suddenly the screen get black and words mixed togetherThe only thing that's keeping me from giving this app Five stars is the fact that I can't post uncompressed photos that are larger than 10mbs at a rough guess. If I try to the app crashes or fails to post the image which is really disappointingWow, I am absolutely blown away by the Instagram Thread app! It has revolutionized the way I communicate and share content with my friends and followers on Instagram. The app's interface is sleek, intuitive, and user-friendly, making it incredibly easy to create and manage threaded conversations. One of my favorite features of the app is the ability to organize my comments and replies into threads.I find it quite annoying that you cant log in with your Google ID and have to instead log in/create an account with Instagram! Also changing your username or name in general... you have to do it via Instagram. I would love to try the App out, but considering that I always have separate accounts accross different Social Medias, I have to wait, until Meta decides to review this issue, in which Im apparently not the only one.Pretty Solid App. Wish it didn't show me threads from people I don't follow, and an easier way to find people and subjects through searching. Very fun and simple to use. Surprisingly well managed and appropriate.There are many problems which I want to address. 1) No themed icon support on Android 2) you can't insert from clipboard if its an image. 3) you can't add gifs and only thing you can add is attachments and that opens gallery. 4) username can't be distinct from Instagram. I use Instagram and Twitter for different audiences so it doesn't help. 5)App doesn't support 60 fps video upload. 6) No button to jump to DM with any one.The developers have already said that this app is a work in progress. Let's hope it gets better than Twitter and simplifies text based posts. At the current stage, the user interface is easy and beautiful. A lot of famous Twitter profiles have already moved to Threads, so it's not lonely here. The biggest issue is that you see posts from accounts that you never followed! It's very very annoying.The app is kinda horrible when I used. When I tried to use this for an hour, it keeps crashing and stop working without any reason. It makes me feel frustrating, I hope meta can fix this problem.This app doesn't even have good features! It just got fame due to Twitter's outage. App UI is horrible! Doesn't even have stuff to do in here. Only good thing is that it uses your Instagram ID as login and you have the option to follow all the people you followed in Instagram, that's a neat feature! APP WILL DIE WITHIN 6 MONTHS!No windows options. Bizarre, for a text based app... typing on a keyboard is still the fastest no matter the speed of your thumbs! Also the searching... trending... aspects as documented eleswhere.The rest of the age will come to know experiment when it is necessary to be more and different even if all looked same yes (feature) could have been introduced in some new form. But he was not kept equal to his rival. It is expected that more good things will be seen in the future.I love the interface but my issue with this app is that almost all of the content I see in my timeline are from accounts I don't follow. I would really love it if the next update would give you an option to have your followings as the only posts you see in your timeline.Good app, still needs more features. For a base app that only released 1-2 days ago, it is pretty good. But there is a lack of features, such as polls. Although I'm sure they'll be adding that stuff later. Overall high quality and engaging app!Objectively better than the alternatives. It's really that simple. Mastodon was ok but everyone left. Twitter was great before it turned into a barely functional sewer fire. Can't tell you about Bluesky because it's been in closed beta since the beginning of time itself. By default, Threads is pretty good. I'd give it 5 stars if it had trending topics/tags and a desktop web app.ive tried mutliple times where i try to reply or start a new thread with a picture, but the picture does not load and instead crashes my app and kicks me out. i can only reply/post with words. no pictures at all.. please im just trying to post art wips on threads i dont want this to mess up on me any longer😭it's getting me frustrated. there are glitches everywhere. i have been restarting the app for several times and the glitches were still everywhere, can't even read a word because of those. kindly fix it, it's irritating.Super, very excellent app. The only bug I noticed is when typing comments, the UI doesn't adjust for the keyboard so that you may see what you're typing.I had high hopes for the app but unfortunately anytime I try to add a photo to my posts the whole thing just crashes. Although still very early, at launch this is a pretty discouraging bug to deal with.I like it. But it needs improvements: 1. Please add the Options to choose pics from another folder. Its so hard to find it just to scroll down all the way. 2. Add the login option for IG lite user like me. This app is good right now especially I can post longer messages, (of course it's name is thread hehe). Good job Meta 👍🏻Using Google Keyboard, the app does not scroll to let me see where I'm typing. The typing area overlaps underneath the keyboard, and I can't scroll to see it. The same happens on Instagram, actually. Please help me fix this. // The app keeps crashingInstalled it thinking this time it would be different but it's way more unorganised than any other app. It's like everyone coming up, dumping on thread, need an update where we can see what we want, I don't know where our preference went, like they asked initially but it doesn't seem like they are even using it.It seems as audio doesn't work on vids uploaded by the android version.. me n other musicians that use androids our audio is muted and the button you click to get sound isn't there.. Audio only works for those that uploaded w ios devices!! This isn't fair to android users!!It's good but it have four problems 1) like instagram it doesn't have the feature to login many accounts at same time. 2) it doesn't have dark mode. 3) it doesn't have the feature to translate bio. 4) There is no edit thread option.It's a good app with a lot of potential, but for some reason I haven't been able to see my notifications or people's profiles (mine included!) since yesterday as it says \"something went wrong\".Nice ui, nice experience. But only problem is we can login to one account at a time. I mean there is not even account switch option. To login other account, we first have to logout from our current login and then go to Instagram switch account and then come to threads to login again. Not on the homepage or in the front but there should be account switch option in the settings.It's great so far! Just wish there was a few things added to it for a better experience: 1) make it easier to switch accounts without logging out first, 2) have a save / bookmark feature, 3) fine tune the feed because I'm seeing way more posts from random people I don't follow, compared with the people I do follow and want to interact withThe app and all is cool interface is also aesthetic the things is everything is connected to instagram which doesn't gives the app its own personality like for example i can't select another username on the app so please kindly change this thing atleast make the app independent plus also introduce the messaging featureIt's just too random with no control over who's post pops up on feed, kills the purpose of following/unfollowing folks. In a way, it's worse than seeing ads. It'd be usable if we could limit main feed posts to only the ones who we follow and then a separate explore/Activity section.I Want To Like it! I just find it really annoying that I keep seeing posts from people I don't follow or things I'm not interested in on my feed MORE than posts from the people I do follow and actually want to see and I have no way of stopping it from showing up. It has potential to be such a good app.Really pathetic app, can't even share my YouTube video link properly only link showsup and the thumbnail doesn't. I was showing up a couple days ago but now it's just the link. They should sync the facebook link debugger for threads as well.For some reason, this app needs access to the following information from your phone: Personal info (even though you'd be providing that yourself) Financial info (excuse me, what?) Health and fitness info (Why?) Messages (Emails, sms, etc) Photos and videos (I suppose it needs access when you want to upload) Files and docs (can you upload files and documents?) Calendar events (is there a built in calendar?) App interactions, installed apps etc Web browser history (What?) GrossI got bugs and can't use the app properly, the texts and the images starts to flow and my entire screen gets filled with the floating texts as I scroll through it. Please look into ittwitter? don't know her. charice. okay but so far, i wish there would also be a media tab and that you can glide across these tabs instead of tapping. there's also no \"pin to profile\" feature yet. and as of now, i still can't post lyrics coming from spotify (both of them should work on that). i'll give it a 4.5 out of 5 (rounded up) as i know that this will still have a room for improvements. keep it up.So far my time on threads have been satisfactory. But this bad boy needs more features. Editing posts, saving photos posts, use of hashtags, direct messages, monetization, third party app linkage, logging without Instagram, and that's all I can say for now.So I tried getting onto the app today and it wouldn't let me and instead made me have to do an appeal with verification to prove its me. I submitted it and they just put a message saying thanks and to wait until the appeal is finished being reviewed to see whether or not I can regain access to my account. Says if they find its not me that it will be permanently disabled which is bs! Hope they fix this and let me back on my account!After 7-8 hours, I gave up. It's a lonely place if you're arriving blind without existing Instagram followers. A default feed full of influencers I can't relate to and if it's possible to search for posted content that interests me, I can't figure it out. I'll check back in a few months when it's more mature. Uninstalling for now.Very annoying that the first time you try to confirm your mobile number you are issued with an alpha numeric code and yet can only enter numeric on your phone!!!!!!! Made me want to uninstall right away. Issue codes that actually work. Plus bcos im on hols issuing the text to my UK number in another language. Very irritating.App keeps crashing whenever I try to upload a pic. Also, had a lot of notifications for follow requests. However, after individually accepting a couple, the rest of them disappear. :/I love the potential of this app and can see myself use it more, but the only way that's happening is if my feed only shows me accounts I follow rather than having somewhat of an explore page on my feed. It's really content and information overload and we already have that with Instagram unfortunately - I don't think I can handle more without deleting one or the other. Please no ads or random algorithms, just a chronological feed of accounts I follow. Also surprised how hashtags don't work here?I had high hopes for this app. Unfortunately there is way too many bugs that makes the user experience poor. Threads is also lacking on lots of features that Twitter currently has. The censorship and invasive data collection is also a big downside. The marketing made me believe threads would rival Twitter but I just don't see that happening. Threads needs a big revamping in order to actually compete with Twitter.Has great potential. Just needs an option to only display feeds you follow and an option for chronological order. Those would definitely make it an amazing app.at first I like it but I started having a problem. It keeps closing. I'm not even done composing my caption. I couldn't upload the photos that I wanted to post because it keeps on stopping. I refresh it, I log out and went online, I redownload the app but still I couldn't post what I wanted to post :<For the devs, here are pointers on how you can improve the app: 1. Allow users to save pictures. 2. Only censor porn on profiles below 18. 3. Have a translation feature. 4. Do not repeat the same mistake as Twitter where accounts that the users aren't following are appearing on their feed. If y'all just wanna make a Twitter ripoff, at least make it a better version from the very start.This is very similar to the bird app, but without the rampant toxicity. It works well enough, but it does feel a bit light on features. Hopefully it will become better with time. Overall, I am really enjoying Threads.I really like it!! Though I have a suggestion that could really help a lot of us users. Please add another option for following where we could only see the threads of the person we follow. I really don't like my feed as it's really messy and too much people I don't follow. I wasn't really interested at all. Plus it's also hard to see my peeps threads because of those unnecessary threads at all.A subpar Twitter with less features, inability to save/share photos, and already being overrun by spam bots. Like it's been up for so little time, one would think they would have pulled all the kinks for fighting spam from their instagram, but no.Doesn't work! It says \"something went wrong\" in the app and I have tried absolutely everything to fix it but nothing seems to help. Very frustrating as i have already spent good 2 hours, uninstaling and clearing cache etc...nothing fixed it.It's amazing that there is a new app for safe spaces and I hope this app won't be a tool for bullying and such things, cause last time that's what they did to twitter. Now I have a problem with the search bar, and I hope in the future there will be an option in which you can search for topics you like or a certain topic you wanna engaged with!! Over all it's good!It's great, just wished it had dark mode and the ability to switch accounts without the app glitching out. I don't want to keep uninstalling to fix it.The user interface is really amazing, smooth and lag free unlike the twitter user interface. This is really a good thing as laggy, smoothless experience can really be so annoyingI like the app very much but if you think it is going to replace Twitter keep dreaming it may be in a mess right now but it is not as tuff as Facebook if you like to add certain content that is for adults that is why Twitter is not going anywhere soon plus you need to fix it so does not use a lot of battery power in the background when it is not being usedIt's pretty ok so far. If it gets better in later updates I MIGHT move from Twitter. Off the top of my head a few improvements you can make is adding a timeline for accounts you follow & let us make other customizable timelines, adding post search would be amazing. Normally I don't like Meta/Facebook products but honestly? As an artist I just want to get out of Twitter and still have a chance getting seen.Pretty good for first attempt. Needs some fixing and features. How about \"lists\" so I can sort who or what I'm following by genre or topic? I would like to be able to read sports info separately from entertainment info. Easier to follow people that way.Past few days, if I try to share a link to an article, instead of it looking like it should, with a preview image & headline, all that shows up is a truncated URL.I really like the UI. I have never used Twitter(i do have a ac) coz most people I know don't use it. But since this is a part of Instagram most would start one. It would be really helpful if I could switch between different accounts just like in Instagram. It's a hassle to everytime log out, confirm the login and use the other account.To best honest Threads is fat better than other social media . I didn't notice anything wrong there but one thing I've noticed that there is a same problem like Elon's Twitter , after posting anything we can't edit that & it was so much disappointing for me . When i was opening the account i thought there should be available that feature bt Alas! So you should add that feature.Meh. With nothing explicit really allowed, it's just Instagram with a more text-based UI. What's the point if it's just Instagram with a different look? Also, a translate feature would be nice.It has a lot of potential, I feel that its missing a few features such as a following/suggestions option on the FYP. an easier setup for being able to see and read replys, I find it difficult to see the replys for a specific post. Another feature I would recommend is a like count on the account page.No dark mode toggle. No alt text. No DMs. One main feed with public mixed in. No pinned posts. App feels very simple and basic with bare bones, which is less than most startups have had. This app is unusable.The app seems ok, but I don't intend to use it until I can limit my feed to people I follow. I don't want to see all that random content, it's mind numbing. Apparently this feature is \"on the list\". I'll take another look when it's done.This app is not user friendly and it's tough to understand the app structure and home page options but and also there are a lot of bugs. I hope you'll fix all the problems in next apdate.This is an Amazing app! I like how it performs, it's buttery-smooth and so fast, I wish they add couple of features to the future updates such as a following page, being able to edit Threads and DMs would be great. But overall it's a great social media app and I'm enjoying it right now.Login was so smooth. No bugs, no lag. Just love the UI. Ofcourse it's not the finished product. Hope it will come up with more features. Cheers ✨Well maintained. Loving it! But I don't know what's happening like when I try to post something with image, the app suddenly closed while selecting anything from gallery. Just check it outDefinitely an improvement over Twitter. Unfortunately there's no way to filter the \"threads\" by time. One post from 12 hours ago was right next to a post from 3 minutes ago right next to a post from 7 hours ago. A little too annoying to be useful at this present time.Just being in the anticipation zone for now. It's a new app. Can't say much but hope for a great service. I would love it to not be a copycat to Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg should think out of the box and bring in more features to make it number 1 go to app. Hello Thereaders. Let's have fun.So far so good! But I see that it should separate from Instagram and become a separate application. Also, a place should be added to the application conversations without the need for Instagram..Threads has plenty of room for improvement. Top of my list is that links should open directly in my browser, not in an embedded browser inside Threads. It'd be nice to be able to edit a newly posted thread, say within a minute. I want to be able to search threads by any word or by whatever Threads is going to call a hashtag. It's better than the bird app and will hopefully continue to improve.My thoughts First off, to log in you need an instagram account, in turn forcing you to get instagram. Second, twitter is just better as everyone is already posting there, making this app redundant. Positives are the name and the layout is kinda nice i guess but twitter is just better in every way. Its the first real twitter competitor in a while, yet it stands no chance.I will give it a 4 but I hope soon I will give it a 5, the app is good by giving a head start by letting you link with your Instagram people fast. But can we please can you link it with IG messages or creating a messaging space also add story options if possible, but otherwise I love the app so much, I recommend it to everyone thanks for the appIt actually deserves all appreciation and respect, Although it's in need for some improvement but it works far so good.. The issue I'm facing now is that I can't publish or write any post, as whenever I try to post something, the app constantly stops working... So plz fix these issues to make ur social platform more convenient and reliable💙 ThxxxxxxPlease fix the smoothness of the scroll, it is sometimes sticky and hard to scroll, and when i scroll fast it was like reversed and not going down, I don't if this issue is occured in other android version. So far this app is good even though it is newDay 1: App crashing when I try to post pictures. Tried 7 mixed photos & vids, All photos, 2 photos -- all crashed even after rebooting my phone. Threads (whats the counter part of tweets?) also lagging. Need to refresh 2-3 times to show up.The potential is there. However, I'd only want to see people who I follow in my feed and it needs to be on chronological order. Furthermore, it would be nice if, when you open the app, it started where it left off rather than jumping to the top.This app is really a nice fresh start! I just want it to have some better function and ofc I know that it has just started so it is still in initial phase. FIRST, I want the post button on top not down since we have to close the keyboard to post. Scrolling also lags a little. Moreover hashtags??? We need hashtags to reach some kind of audience and I want to have a feature to search for threads.It's really nice and comfortable. The simplicity hits (well) and it still is solid. Still waiting for dark mode, hastags, chat, a little etc though and probably more stuff.Works fine. Everything's so smooth, please don't ruin the experience by adding unnecessary features, only implement the important ones. Don't make it laggy amd choppy like Instagram.I know development is still in works but i'm confident that i wouls not like to see suggestions in my feed/ Timeline. If the app must do this, i suggest there be a toggle button that actuall works to turn off suggestions. Other concerns arent as annoying.First of all I like this app. But this app is not working properly on my device maybe it's because of my old device. It's glitching, overlapping subrato pages in one page, etc. Other than that it's an amazing app.I like it right now, it's fun and I love seeing the reactions. I also like how they're numbers on your Instagram account telling you what number you are when you joined the account. Overall a 10/10 thought obviously as time passes my opinion will change. EDIT: i still like this and people need to give it a chance, as it has been only 2 days since the app came out.Very beautiful UI. But please make Likes & Quotes of a thread more prominent under it. & Yes we absolutely need a thread DM. Plus it crashes sometimes while posting threads. I hope it will be better soon. An amazing Application tho. Love it. 🫶🏻Hello Threads team, I'm experiencing overlapping pages on the app, which makes it difficult to use. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. Can you please help me resolve this issue? Thank you, [Rajat]Worst experience on this social platform. The app crashes and the content inside the app Ovelaps each other can't even use it for a single time and can't even delete it. Just a waste of time very disappointed with @metaA bit buggy, i can't post images and some videos sometimes are just either black or No sound at all, but i hope they will fix it, the app overall is so nice and relaxing, very simple and coolVery basic. Doesn't always auto follow who in your instagram list, as stated. Needs things like save, edit and a discover page, like Instagram, if it is to move forward.The deal breaker for this app is the lack of ability to sort all the junk on the home screen to just what we want to see like people we follow. Without that feature, its juat random junk no one wants to read.So far, this is an instant upgrade over Twitter. There are still some things I think could improve it (like the ability to edit posts), but overall, I dig it. Honestly, just go ahead and integrate all of IG's features into Threads, and you have an instant Twitter killer.For an app that was rushed out, I must say that it works flawlessly for the limited features provided, but there's still a very long way to go. Hope Zuck doesn't give up. So much potential, even more so than Facebook I guess. Also, I hope it'll eventually be just called \"Threads\", and not \"Threads, an Instagram app\"; Hinting at a dedicated login with its own sign up and login credentials. Good luck.Oh dear, the app for android is still not stable yet, lots to fix, icons all over the place. I can't even view anything or is it my device. I shall try to install on another device. -Blackberry KeyOne, Android 8.1.0Not even able to login !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - I use FB login to sign in Instagram, Now in this app shows only login using instagram and no option to login using fb. when click login it ask username and password of instagram, as I dont have one ! what do you think of fb logged in users then ! then WTH added login via fb in insta.. not not allowing in this thread.... WORST !!!!App is interesting! I found one thing that enabled me to write this review. It doesn't show View translation feature for the foreign languages thread. I would be big plus for the users. Anyways, At the first impression it is booming!I barely opened the account and I already started receiving spam messages. It is so plain. You can't customize it. It doesn't even show much besides the things that you are not interested in. This app sucks.Ever since I installed it Instagram won't open or crashes. Heading to the bin unless this sorted asap. Android issue looking at multiple reports of same on Twitter. Also need a way to search posts by keywords to see feed of subjects I'm interested in.Trash, if you are looking to see a Twitter killer, Sorry to disappoint you. It's been 3hours, trying to post a Thread but it's been crashing, and it ignores the threads of those you are following and shows you the posts of people it wants to. Lacks most of the features that makes Twitter lovely e g Hashtags, Threads is simply a crashing, bug filled Instagram. I didn't mention that it is data consuming and would advice you only use it on a Wifi that is not yours. In general it's a rubbish app.The app is nice. However, the developer should include changing the username without syncing to an Instagram account and creating an account without using Instagram. I also find the news feed not organized, unlike Twitter. I hope this app will last and improve more.I don't see a single thread or whatever it's called from the people I follow instead it's just random people indirectly begging for followers, and it isn't changing doesn't matter how many times I report/mute or block them. I can't use this app in it's current state neither I would recommend anyone else to.Great v1 app and platform. Has helped hundreds of my friends and acquaintances migrate off of the bird app. Unlike a lot of other apps that have come and gone in the past couple years, this one feels like it's going to stick. 🤞There's no way to see only posts from people you follow in chronological order, so you're never \"caught up.\" Happy to try it again if they change that, but until then it's trying to be an infinite timesink and I'm not into that.The app is easy to use and has a clean interface. It has all the features I need to stay connected with friends and family. I particularly like the community notes feature, which helps create a better opponent for Twitter. Overall, I would highly recommend this app to everyone.There's a lot of glitches every time I just touch the screen, once I entered the app, it just started to glitch. I know this is a new app I'll change my opinion about it later if they'll fix it. Will try to restart my device I guess.Refuse to use this until they enable a dark mode setting. I know it goes off of phone settings, but my phone's theme requires default settings and I like my theme more than I like this app. This should be a simple fix, as every other app this company owns has a toggle for dark mode. Get it done and I'll be a regular user.Poor experience. Slow timeline, unwanted content on main screen, linked with Instagram so when you block someone there it will replicate to the other app. I would be good if we were in 10'sThe app is great but needs improvement. Need DM integrated with the app, trending topics and also adjust the app design to be more identical to instagram, like the bottom bar of actions that has very different icons.So far I absolutely love this app. It's so peaceful and upbeat letting me express my thoughts while following interesting other accts. I would just let ke three things so fingers crossed. DMS, bookmarks, and if at all possible an edit button for us misspelling writers. Beautiful work.At least one thing is true! We need a platform that is only text based social space! Threads and Twitter both are evolving into a multimedia platform - which is not really unique! Y'all still can be unique and don't mix it up!There is a problem occuring in threads by scrolling or clicking anywhere, every post gets mixed with each other and if I click on requests replies, they also get mixed. I downloaded it twice but the problem is same.Promising so far. Please make an easy way to switch profiles like we have on Instagram. Also, I shouldn't have to approve access every single time I re-log in to an account, only when creating Threads and importing from instagram. For users with a personal and business profile, this is an annoying hassle.As I said earlier, it's the perfect Twitter competitor that'll ultimately tone down Elon's arrogance, but it could get better! Zuck and team oughta listen to what the users DEMAND. No video autoplay; one should choose what they wanna watch, make the follow/followers section easily accessible, the search functionality should more or less be like Twitter's, heck, we should be able to read quote reposts etc. The long and short of everything is we need Twitter-like experience.Worst app I have ever seen in my life. It's so damn glitchy and buggy. As soon as I opened the app it started acting in a weird way. All the pages were overlapping and it was looks terrible.so far, the app is great. It needs some improvements like adding hashtags and separating the following threads from those accounts you don't follow, you know, just like in Twitter. and it's hard to make an account. You need to create an insta first before you make thread accounts. I know that's actually connected with that app, but that can be a disadvantage of it.The app is super buggy. Changed my insta password and I haven't been able to sign in. The loading takes ages and at times, images or videos just refuse to load. Work needs to be done.It's OK, bur needs #1 bigimprovement needing to only show what I follow First over \"pushed content\" like I understand needing ads to gain money but I don't want a bunch of other content I don't follow blue check flood in the home menu. If I can expand on it's biggest issue twitter has \"following feed\" and \"for you\" while you only have \"for you\" (ads & recommended).So far so good. Name is a bit confusing with a few other apps but liking the animated logo and familiar feel. It's new so needs some.time to bring features and functionality in (text search for threads a top one for me), but the core product is good.very nice app but the user experience is so bad.... my account was restricted and it requires me to confirm that I'm a human by completing the reCaptcha, yes I have been confirming that since yesterday but the \"next\" button returns \"sorry, there was a problem. please try again later\". imagine since yesterday trying again trying again 😠😠I'm looking forward to Fediverse integration, and the app already seems more polished in many ways than current Twitter, I just wish it collected less data than them too. Downloadable pictures, searchable posts, and followers-only timeline are missed too.It's good but it's like Facebook & Instragram & what'app, twitter competition means that the thread needs to be changed a little more, pay is not working properly, the sound needs to be pressed on each reel, the keyboard is more important than the thread.Any potential thia app once had may have been wasted. Meta clearly rushed this app out the door without giving time to plan out and release updates at a good rate. It is ridiculously hard to grow on the app or see posts your actually intrested in. They don't even have an actual discovery tab or following tab. The apps been out for weeks now and has had virtually no changes. The lack of updates has killed any fun this app once had.It's good that there's no \"Following Tab,\" please don't add Following Tab or if there's any plan to do it, just put the option to make it private. People don't need to keep overthinking about how many followers/following they have. And with no data about it, no one will feel superior to others just because of their follower/following numbers. Let everyone be real and be themselves. Oh, the most important thing, please let our home be clean from the celebrity accounts we don't follow. 😳Nice great conversation & chat app 👍😍. Perfect great solution for asking open conversations (all comments, all replies, and all chats), sharing recent photos & videos, adding like to the recent photos & videos, adding stickers & GIFs, and of course being close friend with all Instagram followers no matter what situations & events it is 😍😍. Great better, easier, faster, and securable app 👍😍.the size of the app is big, bigger than its competitor, that blue bird logo app, with lesser features. 🤷🏻‍♀️ home/feeds?/timeline is quiet messy, would be nice if it can be separated between following only and trending? maybe.I have Android 9, and the app goes crazy once I open it. It is rendering all the screens at once, so whenever I scroll, all of it renders at once instead of rendering just one screen. DisappointedThis app has transformed my smartphone experience with its intuitive interface, customizable options, and smooth performance. It offers a diverse selection of content and exceptional customer support from the developers. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their smartphone experience.We need an organized feed that doesn't lose position everytime we move from it. Have it at least load a certain number of threads that will be shown next when we drag down to refresh the feed and so on. Such a basic featureKinda boring.. missing a lot of features or is hidden in the UI, can't find the trending topics for the life of me. The UI looks simple, too simpleIt's good app but it should be more better if you add hashtags, Trending section. some time it automatically throw you out from the while scrolling. People who are available on thread who are also in our istagram account should be shown for suggestions because there is only one option in start follow all, what if we don't want to follow some of them.The app has a ways to go and got flooded the first day. As a result my page keeps crashing out. Hope it's running smoother soon. Really enjoying the layout.Threads is the best new social media app I've used since 2012. It definitely is not finished features are bare bones however it is a soild platform. I would recommend it. However it does not have messages or friends list or even a dark mode. Other than Facebook or Twitter it stands out!As enticing as the concept is, for some reason, the application runs *terribly* on my device. Crashing when attempting to enter a thread and being unable to scroll through the notifications.Great potential but some fixes needed. I don't get notifications from some of the people I want to know when they have posted, I can't attach GIFS, I see a lot of accounts I don't follow and don't want to follow and have to spend so much time blocking and muting.App crashes on Android, while trying to upload photo. Have already uninstalled and re-installed and logged out of account and changed all permissions. Was able to submit my first thread but any photo upload after that crashes the app...This is clearly a very early and poorly tested version of the app that was pushed out to cash in at the right time. First, the app crashes a LOT. Simply opening certain people's threads closes the app every time, but works perfectly on other threads. This is pretty much a deal breaker. Second, I think it's fair to say a web version or desktop app should have been available from the beginning. The fact that it's missing just means it's all a side effect of rushing out this new platform. AJ 505Looks great. Just a bit complex, for now. Different threads look all packed up together. I think it should have the clarity of Twitter if it's going to be a major competitor. Great initiative though.One of the smoothest app I have used, the reach is good and the UI is good as well, it helps to me change a window in no time and reach out to the new people faster than any other app, loved it. Precisely it has beautiful layout which could trend easily and as I have used it for longer I faced no issues. :)I like it but more control is needed. Unlike twitter you can't turn off random people's feeds that you don't follow, I'm not interested in Arnold swartznegger or a bunch of randos. I'm interested in the people I follow and that's it. I also don't like that I had to go make a burner Instagram account I'll never use. I'll keep it because twitter is burning to the ground but for me personally I'd like more control over my content.It's ok. Interaction bar needs to follow the comment, repost, like, share order like twitter though (it's more ergonomic to have the like button on the right side), and having the interaction numbers clearly visible instead of a dark grey which is hard to read. Still needs hashtags, a proper search feature, and trending topics. Need a home feed with only people I follow. Good for release, missing key features.It a good apps for rivals Twitter but i hope this apps can have a dark mode option so sone people will not suffer for the light mode brightness. Plus please have an option like this from camera, this from Pinterest, this from Twitter and etc when we pick a photo from our gallery so the user don't have to search for the photo one by one. Hope you will improve it💜There's a bug in the app, that whenever I switch between functions of app the texts just overlaps and nothing can be seen, it just becomes a display of overlapping UIs, please fix itIt's actually really good and better than twitter, obviously I kinda expect y'all to keep adding to the app overtime, but my posts get no engagement at 0 followers. So that sucks. Also it is missing some things that I really wish it had, but when they add them I'll change my rating. Overall solid app and better than twitter 🤘🏼Everything is smooth, but is there an update happening? Couldn't seem to open the \"following\" nor \"pending\" tab. I hope it'll be fixed! And also, add \"my liked posts\" tab, and a feature for hiding some posts/threads from specific followers only to be viewed, if that's okay. Overall, I love the new social media!Constantly crashing. Doesnt have any sort of friend/following tab or view. I don't see myself waiting around for the bugs to be worked out..I admire what this app is intended for. Fixes I would like to see would include direct messaging, trending topics, keyword searches, pinned threads, profile banners, chronological timeline.Need to improve media support. You cannot copy paste images/gif via clipboard. Every time need to import it from attachments icon. Voice for videos is not working as well.Not able to open the app. I just installed the application and when I click on open its automatically closed. Please fix it, it's giving a very bad experience to the users.This app is very great since you can share your thoughts or whatever you want to share with it however, I'm experiencing some kind of error while using the apps like \" haven't posted any threads \" even tho I have already. But anyways, I hope it won't happen again because I need to uninstall the app and install it again to use it.Twitter but with more censorship and worse interface. It is altogether a very bad app and I would not recommend downloading it. You have to have instagram to even get into the app which is a pain. They will also deboost your posts and censor you from seeing others. Slow to load too. Stick with twitter as it is a much better app. Very bad do not recommend.Threads is a great app. But it still has to improve a lot. The first problem I had to face is that the profile photo doesn't open by clicking on it. The second problem is that the sound of the video is muted and the volume button does not produce sound.Unfortunately It's first time that a well known app is functioning so weirdly. All things were overlapping each other and I was not able to use a single function and infact it was so malfunctioning that I am not able to read a single line.I really like threads it's like Twitter but doesn't have the subscription to it or the limit to view tweets. You also can follow to your favorite content creators, etc. If you can't find your favorite creator they will be in a pending box and once they downloaded it, it will automatically make you followed. And for the few days it's passed I've been really hooked to it, also for it's few days of the app being released I've seen many nice comments and posts. It's a really nice app I recommend.Seems to have a lot of similarities to Twitter which is great and integrated with Instagram also great. However the main issue I'm having is that I have multiple Instagram and Twitter accounts for different companies and personal accounts and there doesn't seem.yo be a simple straightforward way to switch accounts on threads without it setting off all of Metas security alerts and stopping me from switching accounts from within Threads itself.Well, I'd love to use it but it won't let me post, I keep getting the 'Your thread failed to upload' message for days now. I tried clearing cache, force stopping, uninstall/reinstall...doesn't work. I'm giving it 2 stars because Instagram import seems to work and I could see other people's threads.It's good to have such a space to share your thoughts and create your content with words instead of media .. But I think that the home screen is too messy .. you gotta lower the count of non followed accounts threads in the home screen.I love this app!!! Extremely addicting 🤣 but anyways I wanted to recommend something slight, I would love an option for a post to be \"close friends\" like on Instagram stories I would be elated! Because I am shy writing silly things infront of my extended family. (It would be 5 stars if the app had this option)The app is too good as Twitter, and especially the app is connected directly to other Social Media apps but one thing to come in view is that the app contains many and confusing steps to SWITCH ACCOUNT. Look to Instagram and other Meta apps that contains easy and normal way to switch account quickly. Otherwise the app is amazing. My regards to Mark Zuckerberg 🙏Liking the concept so far, could be fun. Only thing I wish for is being able to scroll through just the people I'm following, separate thread. Also, when clicking on \"follow all on Instagram\", needs to be an acknowledgement that it works. Seems like my pending list should be a lot larger.Good first draft. It runs smooth and I am sure they will be adding functionality. I don't think they expected so many downloads right away but yet it doesn't crash. They seem to have only rolled out what has been well tested. Also, it's not filled with weird vaguely eugenicist posts by the billionaire owner, so that is cool.You have to log in with Instagram. Which in turn shares tons of information. So I looked at all the pictures of the app in use and realize that it is appears to be just be a copy of Twitter. Instagram and Facebook have been instrumental in censorship and data gathering and selling. I will delete it immediately.This app is kinda cool but it also has some bugs. My account is limited and i can't follow people, it shows a continuous error. This has to be fixed. Overall, this is a good appThreads is an exceptional application that has greatly enhanced my social media experience. It offers a unique and efficient way to connect and communicate with close friends, making it easier to stay connected on a more personal level.😊😊It's a great step, but I wish it was more convenient. Placing the comment and like button in accordance to your hand as I am a right handed I would like them on the right side. Double tap on like also needed.This app was unusable because of serious glitches. I couldn't see or scroll anything. To make things worse when I redownload the app I can't even login and app is keep crashing. Meta team should fire the testing team or they will lose billions in upcoming months . So far terribly frustrated with this productgreat app, best to compete with twitter, but glitches out on my phone when started and its not being fixed... please release an update and fix the bug! Also, not allowing to delete threads account without deleting Instagram account is really the worst idea you can come up for. Fix the mistake as soon as you can!!While writing we cannot select words on double click. Its good if You can fix it in next release. Else everything looks pretty fun. Great to see competition for tweeter. Keep rocking metaStill kinda barebones for now, but it's not bad for a new social media app. It def needs some improvement on algorithm and such. Since it's a new app tho, I'll let it slide for now and hope they add more in the future.I know it's because it's new .....but there is a lot of glitch ....when swiping down it's not refreshing, automatically showing posting something new , closing the app randomly, and p.s also add a new feature where you can only see stuff from people who you followsAnnoying - 2 stars coz well done for copying Twitter but it's not allowing me to post a thread. It keeps kicking me out when I try to type. Un-installed and reinstalled ☕ and now it just keeps saying \"posting.... view \" can see everyone else's threads, just not my own feed. I find all of this monotonous. How do i fix this problem?Very good app. I surprised to see a nice app to ditch Twitter. I hope Threads have feature to save picture like Twitter. Since personally i using save picture many times in Twitter. Hopefully dev will add that feature. And if can it will better if we can change region (not language) so i can get better recommended in for another country. Plus we need history to look what post we like before.I'm partly a big fan of Threads. Very smooth interface, quick loading, and instantly compatible with my Instagram profile. However, there's a few issues. Firstly, not many celebs that I admire are on Threads yet - hopefully they will be soon! Secondly, I like downloading memes that people post on Twitter... But on Threads, there's no option to Save Image apart from to screenshot. Apart from that, Threads is a great app. I think I'll be moving from Twitter to here!An amazing start, I wish this app be totally open, but I can sense that there will be a tone regulations comings which is why Twitter is so far ahead, you can literally find anything there, I hope they turn this app into a place for cute msgs and etc. Zuck should definitely make this into the real town square that Elon failed to accomplish.When clicking to post/reply with an image, it opens \"gallery\" by default, not allowing to navigate on the albums. Please use native way on Android so we can find pictures faster instead of a giant scrollingI think Threads could be improved by adding more features, such as the ability to edit posts and the ability to switch between multiple accounts. Overall, I think Threads is a promising social media platform. It's not perfect, but it has a lot of potential. I'm excited to see how it develops in the future.Not a bad app it needs an update becoz whenever I upload video there is audio problem...automatically becomes muted ...u can also can't see live videos on threads ..only notification of live video is coming... Most important is there is login glitch... whenever I switched my accounts on instagram app ..the threads app also log out my account on threads app.. Every time I have to login my accounts on both apps..plz fix these glitches ..thankuGood app so far. A few requests: 1: Themed icon support for Android 13. 2: double tapping the search icon should go to the search page and show the keyboard (like other apps do) as this speeds up searching. 3: customisation like colours and things. Hopefully this will replace that other app..!The app is great but it's also fun*king annoying one minute I can follow someone the other minute I can't Sometime I can't even post really had a rough time with it but I love the app that's why I'm giving it 5 star please fix the issues And another thing it keeps blocking me out of the app some times saying we restrict so so nd so something like that pls fix the appHaven't really explored the app yet, but a slight annoyance that I hope gets fixed soon. It'll be nice if we can switch between accounts like you can on Instagram. Signing out and back in all the time is a painGood experience. I am still learning new things about this app. I am taking more time to learn the total apps features. I didn't take this much time to learn features of an app. The overall user experience, animations, smoothness, are really good. Especially since it linked with insta account, I can directly use my insta bio in this app. It is totally connected to Instagram such made me easirler to find my friends.The app is glitching. I just installed the app and when it opened, it wont show the posts properly. When I clicked the other icons, it justs mixed whats on the screen.Instagram's Threads is a brilliant addition. As a photographer, the selective sharing with a close-knit circle is a boon. It's personal, smoothly integrated with the main app, and respects my aesthetic sensibilities. Overall, Threads gets my full endorsement - it's a game-changer in enhancing my audience connectivity.So far, I like this application. It could use some features like gifs, maybe live stream etc. The tweets aren't repetitive as you scroll your feed, unlike Twitter, and it seems as though you can see everyone thread who posts on the platform, which is cool. Makes following new people easier. So far so good. I'm a meta Share holder too so with this new app I'll be buying more stock options. Lol 😆Just like Twitter! What was needed to make it like Twitter? & it has the biggest problem that is if we wanna delete threads also we have to delete our Instagram account. What is it?Whenever I want to click on it & start to scroll it starts to show me its glitching.I don't know why it's going on my app. I think some users are facing this same problem. Please fix it urgently. Also after hiding badge we need a option to reset it again on our profile. Please create this featureIt's an alright app, simplistic. But it crashes and close it self when I try and write something to post. I have to write the message in my phones notes app and copy and paste it over and post it before it crashesI don't know whats happening on my app, at first it was working very well then when I try to scroll it's creating a feed page that I cannot read .... Things are moving up down.... Can you please fix t....but it's a good app definitely.Love the Minimal but delightful UI. Please don't clutter it! The integration of haptics are awesome. The Scrolling smoothness can be improved though, it feels choppy.The fact that I can't delete my thread account without it also deleting my entire instagram is awful. I feel trapped. Separate them! Wish I had known this before I downloaded it. There's already bots and ads... I don't love it. It's also crashing every time I try to view replies to my threads...Would be better if I could switch between profiles like on Instagram (without having to completely log out as it locks me out of the app). *also if you log out, it won't let you log back in unless you Uninstall and then Reinstall the app.There's a glich in the app.. Whenever I try to open it everything seems to be dragging and it's really annoying.. I tried after installing it again.. But it's still the same... I'm disappointedI installed this app. First day was fun. Today I went to my profile and accidentally refreshed it, it brings my insta profile bio and followers with msg no threads found. And also I am not able to see other people threads, getting message something went wrong. I re installed app and now it's working.After 1 week use of threads app I found its not good because as per meta description there is no option for personal chat through inbox direct message. I still waiting for DM direct message features. I am getting regular many followers but I didn't talk anyone's person. So I would like to request you meta team please find the problem of direct message features and try to solve as soon as possible. 🙏🙏🙏Experienced a bug that made the app unusable, while scrolling the previous content continues to stay on the screen, not allowing me to see anything. Hopefully this bug gets fixed soonCould be better. I recommend not displaying suggested posts and accounts (that I do not follow) on the Home feed. I'm planning to use Threads for staying updated with the news but when random nonsensical posts and memes pop-up, it ruins the experience.Great little side \"app\" to extend the features of Instagram, it incorporates similar page styles to Reddit although not all that comprehensive it gives a streamlined approach to the usual \"doom scrolling\" I've seen on other social media platforms.Needs a lot of work in my opinion. Not getting notifications when those I follow post, all notifications are on, still nothing. Would love it if those I do follow are 1st on my feed. Also, a translate option would be great as I follow non English speaking celebs and have to screenshot posts for translation.So far it's nothing new nor innovative, nor is it anything near Twitter - which is more smooth and users have more control over what is actually on their feed. That sluggish scroll this App has is very annoying and honestly quite irritating.Title: Inadequate Formality: App Needs Its Own User ID, Separate from Instagram The decision to link it with Instagram is quite bad. If the app aims to establish itself as a formal platform, it must break free from this association and create its own user identification system. By relying on Instagram for user authentication, the app loses its independence and fails to establish a unique identity.I am not able to use the app properly because when I'm scrolling the screen the threads are overlapping and everything is very blurry on the screen. Please look into this.Sure, I'd be happy to review Instagram Threads for you. Threads is a standalone app from Instagram that was designed to be a more personal and private way to connect with your close friends. It's a great way to share your day-to-day moments with the people who matter most to you, without having to worry about your posts being seen by a wider audience. Some of the things I like about Threads include: It's a more personal and private way to connect. Threads is only visible to your close friendI like the concept of the app, but I'm having issues with my timeline, it's not showing me the accounts I follow, no matter how many times I refresh the timeline, it shows me random accounts that I don't follow, and it's not because the users I do follow are reposting their threads, it's just giving me random accounts. I want to see the accountsI follow, I specifically didn't tap the \"follow all\" button when setting up my account because I wanted to follow specific people. Please fix this issuePretty well to navigate. A little hard to branch off to find similar users. But my biggest hate and the reason why I give 3 stars is the constant spam of verified users that I don't care about. Their brands do not suit my taste and it's always a large scrolling process to skip past them.So far I hate it, there is no way to turn off threads from accounts you don't follow. Im seeing threads from every account that has joined the platform so far. I've followed every guide to turning this off. I've changed every notification to \" only account you follow\" and I've turned off every category! I'm still seeing threads from everyone. It honestly makes the app unusable for me.its okay! i wish we could look up what we wanted to see, like hashtags and a trending page. I dont really like the UI and it feels like an expanded notes extension that doesnt serve much purpose. But i like it overall !!Pretty mid - concept is cool for those who basically want a PG/clean version of Twitter. Doesn't have direct messaging so no chance of strangers trying to scam you or sending you porn. But it links to your Instagram account so you can't delete your threads profile without deleting your Instagram profile too. Hopefully this mechanism will be scrapped and soon else I can see the app crashing and burning. But you can however deactivate the threads account without it impacting your Instagram.The app keeps crashing when I want to comment on a thread... I use Huawei P30 Pro. I have tried clearing cache, closing all apps, restarting the device, updating the app and nothing seems to work.It started on a good foot and it can be better if it includes the following: -Save post and categorize/sort them in a folder -Close Friends, just like in instagram stories -trending topics under search tab -list, just like in twitterThis Instagram threads app doesn't seem to work properly on my phone and all the writing seems to overlap each other, plus it looks like it's either crashed or frozen.I like the app, but please let us select album from the gallery for the attachment option. Will edit this after I explore the app. Everything seems to be at basic right now, let's see what will be added at first update.Home screen is full of people I don't follow and I have to search for people I follow individually. Just make the home screen like insta. Then when you search you can get the other suggested people. I'll give it a week then delete it if it's not usefulIt's smooth & i love the fact that Threads have no theme colour, it's just white or Pitch Black. And, well for now it's in need for major upgrades. The settings ui, thread pinning, over-all experience. The point is, how different it is from Twitter & Instagram.Much slow and bugs... Felt like a Juice product of instagram+twitter. It doesn't seems attractive or something new or interesting, maybe it will become best later with owners (@mark) interest - if he makes it compulsory to go beyond instagram. We're committed to use all the things as you deliver to us... Hope for the best. tnQ.Best social media App so far,..to make make it all in one...can you modify the app to be able to have the LIVE option like facebook and also to be able to contact the owner of a certain account either through video ,audio calls or be able to text and send images or video to the owner of the account ( end to end encripted ) and i if one could create a group or community ( just like messanger or whatsaap ) for sure this app will be 👌.This app does not support keyword search. As an active Twitter user, this is a showstopper, and the app is next to useless for me. Having that feature currently in the pipeline is understandable, but the fact that Meta decided to hype a beta version just to gain momentum over Twitter is embarrassing and disappointing.It works. Easy to sign up (linking to existing IG), intuitive even for an elder millenial like me. I'm not a Twitter user and am just there for info, not to engage. Cleaner than Twitter's interface. Also, dark mode worked great.My biggest problem with Twitter is that it has no “edit” button and I am an impulsive commenter. This appears to be the case with Threads. For me, Facebook will always stand out for having this great feature. Sometimes, I deliberately post shabbily on the App just to capture the musings. Knowing that I can always come back to flesh out what’s been wrongly done kind of endears the App to me. Mark Zuckerberg must quickly afford us this feasibility on the Threads.I love how simplistic it is. I also really like that you can't DM, so I feel like I won't get harassed by bots. It's way more simplistic compared to Twitter, but I prefer it this way. - Update 7/15/2023 I lower my review to 3 starts because the app stopped working properly. It won't load posts on anyone's profile including mine anymore. My activity feed will not load. And I can't load replies on posts. It's really disappointing.Keeps saying it sent me a code to my cell to verify, however never got one. Then said I tried to many times. Then would not let me inform 24 hours only to have same to happen again. I got in initially on Threads and Instagram. Liked, followed then the above kept happening. Still can't use either.It's a good start, nice interface. Let there be free speeches man, Direct messages is important. Saving videos and pictures. I believe it can be a good competition to TwitterAmazing app to be honest but I've been having problems with my media playback. Like videos do not make a sound at all so please fix it but other than that it's been goodDefinitely has the potential to work well. Needs to iron out some bugs with refreshing and more features. I expect the next update will be much smoother.Just a small issue with dark/light mode. Can't switch between dark and light mode, even if you switch to light mode on Instagram, it stays in dark mode. Think you missed that. Everything else, dope 😎The application is really great!The Ui and scroll is soo smooth.The animations are really good. I really hope this application stays this way, never add any other dumb features that you did to Instagram. For now Threads is a great place to be.It's a Twitter like experience withour many of the issues Twitter currently has. HOWEVER my biggest gripes are how the algorithm suggests accounts to follow and places posts in my feed. For now, I find myself scrolling past lots of posts and accounts that mean nothing to me but Threads keeps putting them in my way. Once this is addressed, I think I'd be inclined to spend more time using this app but for now it's kind of tedious and boringThe app is really better in comparison to Twitter. It's a good start. Just need some improvement... Mark Zuckerberg saved us from Twitter. 🤍 One more request There should be a Translate option beside every thread in the (...). Telegram is a good example. If any thread is not no English it'll show an option to translate in English.It's pretty solid. The one issue I have is when I try to post photos, it keeps crashing and it stops working. I just want that issue to be fixed, everything else is ok.Was rushed out the door, lack of features, and lack of pages/people to follow. Also the app uses a lot of personal data, so be wary of that.I have to give it the lowest possible rating due to how awful the main feed algorithm is. I'm following tons of people, but constantly get screenfuls of posts from accounts I don't follow, and see many of the same ones repeated over and over. JUST SHOW ME WHO I FOLLOW!Something went wrong. Everything is not working. Please fix it and add some features like downloading button of pictures, editing captions in a post.Day 1 and I like it... so far smooth ui, potential for greatness... but some minor glitches and issues loading replies sometimes... would be nice to see number of reposts and quotes soon... room for improvements of course, but strong start.Teething problems as expected, on android need option to be able save photos. And be able to zoom in pictures and stayed zoomed in rather than keeping hold of pic. Also be able to search threads, when you currently search just the profiles come up and not the threadsNeed a draft for threads and sometimes it doesn't allow me to upload higher quality or size images and videos and even when that is the case it should mention the reason why the post was not uploaded rather than 'Unable to post' . Otherwise all good.This app is great and so much better than Twitter, but my second day of using the app it start to crash or tine out once you open it. I had to uninstall to stop the crashing in order to see the house feed. Please fix problemsVery annoying with that very Instagram feature where it thinks it knows better than I do and shows me posts from people I don't follow. Stop it! And if you want to ve a twitter alternative give us a chronological timeline and stop showing me people I don't follow. Up to the minute info is what newshead use twitter forJust show me who I follow. The timeline is too cluttered with random strangers unrelated to who I follow... Makes it very hard to use the app for more than 2 minutes at a time.The app's got a lot of potential, but right now it's quite hard to find posts you actually are interested in. The fyp seems to be random and has little to do with the posts you like or the accounts you follow, and you can't search for posts. It would also be good to to have a seperate tab for posts from only people you followIf you are to copy, you should be good at it. There is a lot is missing to make more Twitter. At the moment, it's labeled as a ghost town... we need to know the trending stuff and real-time news... add a search for content... not just followers.. if am to stay.Being a first-week user, I've experienced improvement and better stability in just 10 days. Features are hearty at launch, learning curve is very low. Not pornified, no crypto bro or tabloid ad bombs (yet). Very stoked for Threads.Absolutely fabulous first day. I did notice Elon's buddies coming over and complaining a lot when they went back on Twitter. But they get mad because they do s***** things and then get caught. Other than that it worked really good. Cons are it needs an edit button and it needs a way to select the type of things that you want to follow for example politics animals etc. Have a great day I was really happy to see everyone show up.I see the appeal to leave the bird app but that's no excuse to roll out a half baked app. Search is not functional at all. No hashtags to find related or trending content. Videos with audio should unmute when I tap on them to play. No GIF support in posts. There's so much that needs fixing.\"Your thread failed to upload.\" Useless app, nothing works except the feed which can't be sorted and search is only for names but no matter, clearing cache, uninstalling etc. it is still impossible to post or see notifications.Intuitive app design, however, the inability to choose which Gallery app you want to use to select media and not being able to edit the media you've chosen are joykillers. Bookmarks missing is also something of note. Hope that changes soon.Has a few glitches that need to be sorted out, but otherwise a solid improvement over Twitter. Looking forward to the updates when they start fixing bugs.The app crashes when I try to post a photo. Sometimes, it allows one or two photos, but sometimes crashes when only trying to post one photo.It's pretty good but it is a lot for the first couple of days. Baby steps, but I prefer wasteof.money because it's smaller. Edit: this is pretty good +1 star. The problem is the community is really abnormally almost annoyingly large.A lot of potential, but it's still way too buggy. It's also way too sensitive on its auto-ban system. I'll follow 10 people, and then can't follow anyone else for at least 24 hours. Hoping Meta fixes all the issues soon so that I don't have to leave and come back later. Updating to say that they never respond in any way when you report an issue. 0 actual support.Like it, a little feature-plain, but overall an okay experience. Strangely though, it keeps crashing & I have no idea why, but it's probably a my-phone thing since I haven't heard anyone else talk about it.it looks really good but the biggest negative for this app is the linking to Instagram. a lot of times on twitter like apps I do not want people knowing my real name because people are crazy and having a shown username and hidden real name can protect people who don't want to use their real name out of fear of harassment or stalkingThe feed is a real mess (like Instagram). I can't select to see just who I follow and can't be adjusted chronologically. Very frustrating.Some sort of static content retention mechanism to show the last seen Thread before closing the app after a re-open would be perfect. New threads should show thumbnail of their publisher's pfp at the top, giving the user the control to go up or go down the feed.pretty good so far but some flaws - I think the feed needs to be improved, refreshing kinda does nothing and i almost NEVER see any posts from people ive actually followed, even though when i check their accounts individually they have posted new stuff. the large majority of posts is from influencers, brands, celebrities/micro celebrities etc. basically anyone with a verified account and large following, which is annoying as i'd rather see the accounts ive ACTUALLY followed. otherwise its okayExcellent application! Such a great place for a conversation. But I've seen some glitches while opening the app. However the application running very smooth on iOS. Thanks to Meta 😄Since you want to copy Twitter, copy it good, I can't pin posts, it's not colorful, I can't chat like on Twitter and Whatsapp, the logo makes me sick literally, why can't I bring back my barge on Instagram when I accidentally remove it and why can't our birthdays be announced, but I'm sure glad I have a second Twitter, all my suggestions should be sent to threaders and you should hear from them but please consider my suggestions, thanks.Created account. Account instantly suspended for no reason. Tried to appeal suspension and it needed to verify my phone number. Put in phone number to receive verification code. Code never comes. Try again. Code never comes. Try again. Too many codes requested. Try again later. What did I do wrong?What's the point of following people if their posts never actually show up on your home tab? Instead all I see is random people posting about how much they like Threads, so it really just looks like the app is trying to make itself look good without actually doing anything useful.so far, it's good. but can you include private message and having a shortcut to switch accounts? it's good and it will even be better if many social media influencers and celebrity get to know about the app so, i hope you can advertise it more because it's boring if they don't join inIt's a far worse version of Twitter. Only one feed filled with random accounts I have 0 interest in following. There's no hashtags, no related accounts pop up when you follow someone. Account is attached to Instagram, so you'd have to delete your insta account to delete your threads one and there's trending tab of course. It's not horrible but feels very rushed, random and insular.@globalrealtor _ An App that is very functional catches my fancy. I love the fact that it's seamless and I can easily network and run my Real Estate Business and other businesses I manage effectively. The beauty of this is meta has seen continuous improvement and innovation in this sector. I believe to see more of this soon.This second I enter the app and touch the screen one time , it's over ! It's starts gliching like crazy comments get on top of each other and all you'll see is white . I deleted and redownload it 5 times and still them same problem.It's really nice and comfortable. The simplicity hits (well) and it still is solid. Still waiting for dark mode, hastags, chat, a little etc though and probably more stuff........Phenomenal app. Account and profile and followers sync seamlessly with Instagram so I was able to jump right in with all my followers and followed people. The app is well-designed and fast. Far better than Twitter. I hope it keeps up.A very good start as a basic social media app, the design is awesome and I love its details but of course there's a long way to go with the other features that need to be added for a better experience.There are limited features as compared to Twitter, which is what it's trying to be, but overall, it isn't poorly designed frankly wish there was more of a \"recommended\" feed or other features akin to twitter that goes beyond who you follow on instagram. I'll probably write another review as the app developsGood start, but would be nice to add a few new features. Hashtags, whats trending, and an option to switch between multiple accounts instead of logging out.So far, nah. I'm not saying Twitter is good - because it's not - but even the app store I downloaded this app from has a dark mode. A lot of people have light eyes and can't handle bright things. White on white is actually painful to me. I'll update rating, if they add a dark mode.Great app twitter rival and a good one I used it on the first day of its release liked it. Mr musk is making twitter limited and pay for blue tick is very bad. Money can't buy everything. Hope this app will stay and more and more people come on this and this app should not follow the steps of musk and FB ads factory and keep our data save. Good luck treads.It's working fine but there are a lot of features that needs to be improved. One most important I would like to mention is that deleting Threads account should not affect Instagram account at all. This is a very big disadvantage that needs to be improved ASAP.I mean DELETING & not deactivating.So far so good, app is easy to use, tho it would be nice to be able to choose the photos from their folder instead of scrolling all the way down just to post it in the appSo far its great.needs some improvements here and there,like the algorithm for example.i really like the user interface,its very clean and its just a chill time in threads.hope it doesn't turn out to be like twitterI downloaded it and didn't like it because of it is a replica of Twitter and offers nothing different and innovative. It is heavily biased too and you can get censored for sharing funny Zuck memes. Anyways, I then deleted the account and lost my Instagram of 7 years in the process because I didn't read the fine print. I don't recommend this. Stick to IG or Twitter.I haven't had it long but so far it's pretty neat! The app functions well without lag/bugs, it's easy to navigate overall a pretty nice addition and a good alternative to twitterWhy can Meta not figure out how to make a gallery selection tool? Why do I have to scroll through all 12000 pictures on my phone instead of being able to select the folders or albums that I have made? Same garbage as Facebook. The only option when making a post is \"gallery\", about as useful as a poopie flavored lollipop (Patches O'houlihan, 2004)I really love the THREADS, the design, the interface, the fonts, ans everything. I hope they will improve it more like the edit button, emoji design and add some trendings to know what's happening in our world. Such a great app! 🩷I don't see a point in this app. 1) I can't search for a specific post based on keywords. Or related topics 2) cannot know what is happening locally because there is no location based trends. 3) I don't understand the feed. It has nothing that I'm interested. I don't know why I'm asked to view those posts. 4) I cannot use the app to DM anybody.Threader is great but not perfect yet. Here's what @zuck needs to fix ASAP. → DM: allow us send direct messages on Threads. → Insight: we need to see analytics to measure growth → Cover: we need cover photos in our bios for proper branding → Quote Threads reader: we need to be able to see the quotes on each post → Media: Allow us check out only media on profiles (e get y). What else have you noticed that's missing that needs to be fixed ASAP?The concept is great, but it constantly crashes and the more posts you mute concerning certain topics, the more you see if that topic. What's the point of the mute function if it does the opposite?There's no filtering on the feed. It's just an endless stream of inane/pointless comments from people desperate for attention, begging people to follow them etc. This isn't a social media platform, it's a self promotion one. It wouldn't be so bad if I could filter to see content that I'm interested in but threads like \"I'm addicted to yakult\" are so utterly pointless. Like, good for you, super interesting, can't wait to hear about your favourite brand of toilet paper. Urgh.The app is having a big problem. I have logged in with my Instagram account. But when I scroll down to view people's post it turns white and also glitching. I have uninstalled it and installed yet the problem still remain the same. Although the app is nice but it having problem. Please fix it.I'll start by saying I've enjoyed being on threads, when I can get on it that is, as it just crashes constantly, always when I'm trying to reply to people. And the problem is it crashes, I then have to remember who I was talking to or the thread I was on and find it again. Only for it to crash again and again and again. I'm at the point where its unusable in its current state. Needs a lot of work.Search feature won't work. Yesterday morning it worked, in the evening and today simply doesn't work at all. Very frustrating when trying to find specific accounts which I know already are active on the platform.Great App, very easy to navigate and understand, just some few suggestions please; 1. One should be able to view profile pictures 2. New followers should be placed the way they follow so one can easily identify who is following or not.Terrible functionality with photos, images. Yup, it's Instagram, you can't zoom without autoreset, size and quality are bad, and yeah... you can't download it.I was expecting a good app but it's totally second Instagram app. I was expecting app like Twitter because nowadays it's dead, people would come to this app if it's more advanced than Twitter... What i was expecting? It give bluecheck to those who has real names having nic id. It should be separate from Instagram It should not collect people's data It should have unique timeline (like Twitter). It should be more secure + very strict about people's self respect, filter bad words auto.I am facing some problems like, when I am trying to post something the app crashes 😐and it's happening again and again. Everything is fine as long as my network connection and mobile phone.. I don't get it what's the problem is..What is the point of creating an app that is litteraly facebook but as an instagram surfer. Moreover, you are copying twitter with all its specs and you got a new way not only to know every single detail about our lives but to actually know every single word we want to say. Try hard app!Just after I logged in all the pages started to overlap and I couldn't even use it. I even reinstalled the app 2-3 times but it didn't work. Please fix this bug because I wanna use this app.Well, it's seems good start, but I have suggestions for the developer, the firsthing is a separated timeline, because it's so chaotic, timeline don't follow our interest, it's a random very-very random. Please make a better timeline, with all data you have I think this not to hard to implemented.Stop forcing cross-platform user profile sync. I get your business model is to build data models of each of your users, but stop trying to farm me at every single faucet of online activity. Just allow a simple username/password to create an account instead of forcing users to sync from Instagram. I shouldn't have to create a new Instagram account just so my legal name is tied to an account for a new social media app that who knows what kind of secops are in place for.Privacy nightmare it is when you become a marketing object in meta ecosystem. There's no option to sign-in using using an email or any other ID. Ultimately by using your Instagram login you're exposing yourself too much for a company's business over the Internet showing your activities and views. That's even if you don't post anything because app tracks you 24/7.Audio get mute when video uploaded, so many features have to improve, so any features not working properly. Need much improvement. I must say that it's unsuccessful imitation of Twitter. Finally I say it's totally BAKWAS App.I am using a device on Android 9 and the app is not functioning properly it glitches and the surfaces overlaps with eachother like its hacked or smn. Please look into it (update : it only happens in dark mode)New app new experience looking forward for more features, it's just launched recently and I downloaded it immediately and actually its easy to navigate.... But I suggest to add translation for the foreign languages that's all I find issues and I'll wait for new updates for new features 😍Okay, it's impressive. I use Tw because it's more comfortable than Instagram because it much give us a text than a picture. Where picture is the reason why Instagram is more being used by children which it makes me uncomfortable with them. But now, there is Threads for Ig user, so I would like to choose it.Really loving the app so far, but there is a serious issue with watching video clips where when I click the unmute audio button the video will just stop playing and freeze frame.Not to shabby for a start, but it lacks features. I also don't like how it collects data and the fact you can't delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram account. I'm sticking with Twitter until they can figure it out.Nice app Feels like Twitter and Instagram just had a baby....... twinstagram..... lol But it's a new app and with all new apps there are things to fix... example....we need to be able download pictures and videos to our phone library without having to screen shot or screen record......thank youVery glitchy first experience. While scrolling all the text leaves a trail of itsself and doesnt get refreshed. So it's hard to scroll and read.I will give 3 stars for now since it was just released recently. But one problem I have is the amount of random posts from the followed accounts from the people that I follow is annoying for me. I hope there will be an update soon for controlling your newsfeed and improve users' interface.This is honestly one of the best apps ever. I am glad this doesnt have adds. One suggestion i would like is that when a person you follow repots something- there should be an icon that will notify you instead of having to go to their profile. This is truly a nice appSlim downed Twitter, but better! The community has embraced positivity over negativity for the most part and the overall app experience has been great. As a new app, very feature light but easily usable for text-centric conversation and newsThis app is amazingly good and pleasingly perfect for me, although there is some features and interactive thing that need to be added and fix but I would definitely recommend you to download this new app because it's so professional,ethical and great.🥰🙈This has potential. Still needs some updates to make it usable fulltime. Needs: -Following only feed in chronological order -Start feed where you last read, current feed jumps to top -Allow third party apps access Do that and I'm done with Twitter foreverTwitter clone that shows you a bunch of stuff you from accounts you didn't follow, and doesn't let you turn that off. It has potential but in it's current state it's just a feed of spam from \"verified\" accounts with the occasional post from your friends.I was able to post thread, but now all I get is \"Your thread failed to upload\" whenever I try. I can post replies, but no new threads. I have cleared cache, reinstalled the app, and I am on a good network. Yet, I still can't post. Help me fix this issue and I will change my rating.The app is full of glitch. Can't even scroll the feed section as it shows only some glitchy mess. I think the app does not support in every phones. The app is a complete glitch in my phone (Redmi Note 8).Your notification system really needs to be improved. I clicked the bell for some account but it doesn't change anything, I always miss their updates.Lacking a lot of features and functionality, so the user experience is currently far inferior to Twitter. Really only useful to people who have a large following on Instagram, the growth potential for smaller accounts is virtually non existent. Nice clean UI thoSo easy to sign up if you are already on Insta. Like the interface, but they need to make some changes so that people can differentiate the posts easily. Rn It takes some effort to be able to tell apart which post belongs to whomGood start. Hot for a minute but hype has died. Please modernize app for foldables (Twitter is). I'd like to keep it open while doing other tasks. Also please add features to differentiate app from Twitter. Right now it's a lesser clone. Once the new app hype dies out, people will see it's not better than what already exists.This app doesn't work in my Android phone like seriously 🙄 whan i start this app and touch the screen all words starting glinching like a bugs or something all texts starting brurr and fly..... Very bad bcoz everyone using this app peacefully and i can't even open it without getting glitch.It's a good apps, but there is much things that needs to improve. We can't edit the photo, we cannot choos the photo from the album.This app is amazing! It could use features like GIFs and live streaming. Unlike Twitter, the tweets aren't repetitive and you can easily see everyone's threads. It's making it so much easier to connect with new people.A very good application. I am happy to be one of the first to register in this new application. I hope to become one of the content creators and among the most influential people on the Threads platform. It also seems that Mark is very ready for me to compete with Elon Musk hahaha, good luck for the best of course 👋🏻 I wish a lot, Mark, if you put it, especially watching videos of Reals such as Facebook and Instagram, as it will have a great impact in attracting a large number of users. 🇩🇿📍Good experience, smooth till now (till the meadia, reel nd filmy people joins for promotion) , needed some tweaks - feature to make it most interesting. Pls keep this text oriented as much as possible.Buttons are very unresponsive, theres no feed with people that i follow, and no text search (only account). Needs a lot of work. Also you can only log in via instagram.Unbelievable this app, even after 2 years of development, decided to launch w/o hashtags, a following-only feed, translation for posts and other basic features that are standard with social apps. If you want a Twitter alternative that serves you better, Mastodon is by far the only one.I like the app since you can share it to Instagram and also it is so high quality but one thing is that i want to see on my feeds like the accounts i followed seperate to those people who's using the app because for me only it's kinda messy. Or maybe im stupid to didn't know the meaning of the app well myself didn't like other people. I love yllThis app definitely has potential. Clean UI but it still has a lot of bugs. Can't post photos or videos right now. Interesting to see where this will go.Nice 👍 , But need but some features are missing... like DM, place to find liked posts... can't add hashtags as well. Hopefully in the coming days, we will see the features added and some more added features.Installed the app. Its not working right. The screen if tapped into anything aftrer opening the app, shows a buggy window just like in the past with slow internet connection! Redmi note 5 pro!This is what Twitter wanted to be until they changed their management and ruined it by letting rampant hate. Longer posts, simple engagement, just better Twitter. It just needs to continue to add things like video, gifs and such. Happy with it. Happy to have SWITCHED to it.Needs work. The algorithm curated timeline only shows me two or three things from people I follow before switching to random things from strangers I'm not interested in. This app desperately needs a chronological timeline of just people I follow. Still gets 3 stars just for making Elon Musk cry and pee his pants.The app seems pretty slick. It's missing some basic things like icon theming, being able to insert gifs / images from the keyboard, etc. Also people you don't follow show up on your feed.Just an FYI, a lot of these bad rating are from Twitter, and they don't like how it's not up to their expectations cause they are used to how Twitter is. Definitely not the app for them. Threads is new and more for the audience that is on tiktok kind of way. So, of course, they are gonna say the people posting on there sound stupid we are young and posting for our audience that find things funny and entertaining in our interest.Good. But, needs improvement. App keeps crashing when I try to post a photo. I am inundated with threads from people I am not even following. Meanwhile, I am not able to see threads from people that I am following. The app should have an option, like Twitter, where you can hide any attached media in threads from people that you are not following. Another option that I would like to see that Twitter had, is the ability to turn off rethreads from people I am following. I like to see direct posts.Literally just Instagram and twitter merged Nothing extra In fact would even say its worse than twitter, twitter shows likes replies etc. With an icon and a number in a much cleaner way Also once you sync your Instagram and threads u MUST have the same handle on both? Also there are still bots....This app is clearly very poor tested and improved. All the texts overlap and smudge on scrolling. All the defects start just after logging in and is endless...as a new app it's good for the time being, but I highly recommend to add a dark theme setting and post translation cuz I don't understand all languages . but all in all , my experience is good 💯Dear Instagram Please work on the existing bugs & issues before launching any new features. I have been repeatedly reported an issue regarding Instagram reels from past 4 months. Kindly give a response at sort it at the earliest.Recently joined this app. App is still in the development stages and many things are missing. However. I absolutely loved the competing app before new owner tore it apart. I think Meta owner and his Executive have potential to tear ceiling off that and may have learned something from competing owner's recent failed experiences. I have much hope for Threads!I like the simplicity of this app , it is new but it's so easy to understand about the features. the edit profile view card feature impressed me most.A fair warning: using this app gives facebook the right to all your data, and you can't delete the account without deleting your instagram account. Aside from that issue, there is so much basic functionality missing. How did Facebook (Meta) ever greenlight this app?Decent. Lots of issues in reloading, Mark Zuckerberg page is not even loading. Search bar sucks. Apparently searches only people and not keywords. Should come up with an alternative like #hashtags. No geo location which was basically made famous by Instagram. No DM feature.I personally actually really like it. No random crashes. The transition between Threads and Instagram is also very seamless. Can't wait to see if they add new features (Voice notes/Spaces) lolShowing much glitches ..and letters, sentences, words are collapsing with each other.. tried to reinstall it several times ...but still the same result... Fix it soon..Well this sucks... This is not like Twitter, nor a Twitter replacement, because it seems that the only way to use/sign-up to use this app is by already having an Instagram account, and/or creating an Instagram account.. So if there's a way to independently sign up on unable to find it.When I first download it worked perfectly fine but now all the articles are merging on top of each other every time I open the app. This glitch is so bad that I can't use it at all.Amazing app. Just needs more optimization. Like you have to add accounts in the starting if you have more than one accounts. You can not have more than one if don't add them in starting ❤Such a bad app, doesn't even work on my phone. Everything starts getting cluttered as soon as i scroll or go to any other page. Really bad experience. Could've at least tested and published a beta release 🤦‍♂️I think audio should be automatically enabled while posting but right now it's disabled until you enable it. Hence, lots of videos posted without audio.I like the app though the DM feature is very welcome. Additionally, additionally, a home feed just for people you follow would be good ADD HASHTAGS! I'd recommend that you also find a way of showing us what's trending. With proper implementation of user feedback, twitter won't be the primary go to app. One more thing, avoid censorship!I'm not able to deactivate my account. When I click on deactivate, I'm immediately logged out of my account. But the case is it's still visible to my friends and to check I tried to log in back immediately and my account was logged in which means that my account is not deactivated, if it was then I would not be able to log in back immediately. I request you kindly look into this matter and do something about this immediately. Also I faced the same issue with Instagram sadly.I cannot even use the app. It just breaks down into a mess of text and repeated images. It's so bad it would get top page of r/softwaregoreDefinitely needs some work to be done on it (lacking a messaging feature and switching accounts takes longer than it should) but a really solid social media platform.I like the idea of this app, but there's an issue because mine is not working properly because it's bugging, like the text is and some of the pictures are not moving and not syncing, and I wish this would be fixed immediately so we could use it.Very confusing timelines. please add features to view by following only or add custom list view. i dont need to see random artists threads, because it's annoying. also please add theme background to dim / black, because it's too bright.its good , with nice ui , but i wish there was an option where you could get rid of the timeline full of influencers and celebs when you refresh. its so annoying seeing posts from people i dont know and dont follow, probably the only thing stopping me from moving over to threads entirely , i hate itThe app is unusable for me. The screen gets overloaded with text. I can't see anything properly. It's almost like if it's glitching. Please helpThe app itself is a decent setup. It's slow right now but I'm sure that'll be fixed later. The main issue for me is the link between IG and threads. The appeal of Twitter is that it's a different vibe. I don't want the same name on threads as I want on my IG. This is supposed to be the least formal site. I don't keep up appearances on Twitter, but I do on IG.In it's current state this app is awful! I can't even find any threads that the people I follow might have posted. They are lost in seemingly hundreds of random posts from random people all around the world. I have deactivated my account until Meta gets round to producing an option for you to just see posts from the people you follow!I'd like it more if it would stop booting me out every time I try to reply to anyone. What makes it worse is when I open it up again I can't find the thread I was replying to. It would also be good if it was easier to use gifs and search for topics you're interested in.I believe I may be the first person to write a review about this app, and I already love it. However, Threads takes the crown as the best. I think it would be beneficial if they added a message button, allowing users like me who don't have large accounts to reach a wider audience as well, because I noticed people that is enjoying it the most are people that have large audiences on Instagram, my account joshdehustler, still never breathe shaI like the app though the DM feature is very welcome. Additionally, additionally, a home feed just for people you follow would be good 🤌🏾. ADD HASHTAGS! I'd recommend that you also find a way of showing us what's trending. With proper implementation of user feedback, twitter won't be the primary go to app. One more thing, avoid censorship!The app keeps glitching, I've deleted it and installed it multiple times but it's still bugging, I can't rate it right now because it's not working, can you please fix it 🙏I'm cool with this. But seriously, need a timeline of just the people I follow, yeah? Keep a discover tab or something for this, but I wanna know what the people I'm following are saying. Otherwise, what's the point? Also, an easy way to group people I follow, so that all my cat pictures are in one group, all my charity updates are in another, etc.Cannot even scroll my newsfeed. It is so glitchy and when I scroll something, it looks like trailing. If I can attach pictures, I would've attached the screenshot. Please help me rectify it.Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't appear that you can sign up for an account directly in the app. You must create an Instagram account first, then use those credentials to sign into Threads.please add favourites as an option just like what u have on ig just so I could choose whom accounts I want to see and interact on my feed. also, please put some features where we could see whom on my followers and following I haven't followed and whom doesn't, it gives us confusion once u hit a hundred followers. thank you! I enjoyed the app so muchInterface is good but add more features like twitter polls, spaces, dm, bookmarking, send to dm. Also on Twitter when you open it you are exactly where you left while on here the for you page is really messed up.Not even close to compare to Twitter. It's an Instagram with a different layout. Same strict rules and awkward format. Impossible to search for posts rather than people. It may be a good alternative to Instagram but not to Twitter.The whole app crashes each and every time I attempt to post my first thread. I've cleared cache and reinstalled it, yet the problem still persists. Very bad.It's great if you're comfortable giving Zuckerberg and therefore the Feds via backdoor, access to every activity, keystroke, every last bit of data (meta or otherwise ) and every piece of personally identifying information in real time . For the purposes if selling information about you to advertisers so they can better persuade and predict your next purchase and squeeze every last bit of value from that data by auctioning it off to the next data broker.Pretty descent so far, definetly has potential as i see it. One big thing is a bug where i try to add a photo to a thread and it just closes the app wiping the thread and any textThanks to threads app my Instagram has a bug now.. Every setting is altered.. Most of app features that i used regularly, are unfunctional now Can't even restore them with my updated app.. Tried every kind of thing,even reported it to tha meta center,and it is still unresolved..Love love the app already. But could you please put an option where we can choose a picture or videos according to their folders. it so hard when I scroll through the gallery from the app looking for a photo I want to post. Thankyouyou people really need to add a permanently deleting option which doesn’t concern the Instagram account. ik It's a great marketing strategy and all but it’s getting annoying. when I thread stuff I don’t want people to know my actual Instagram account. that was literally the whole point of anitwt. ughhh It's getting annoying.Just doesn't work.. I see posts but no replies instead it only says something went wrong.. And can't post anything only said post failed to upload. As it is now it's useless and I would hate going back to twitter.. I tried every suggested fix that can be found on the Web.. Nothing works..Trash. This is a waste of time yall. They keep distracting us with bs instead of dealing with real life. Why do i need to see how everbody feels especially when u wont allow me to see content from people i follow unless i tap on each of their page. Why would i be interested in peoples content that i do not follow. Its like there forcing you to engage virtually and not go outside stay woke\"Threads is a fantastic app developed by Instagram that lets me share photos and videos with my close friends and family just like on Twitter. The app's design is exceptional and it's the perfect platform for staying connected. Highly recommend! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\"This new app is very amazing! It's just that once you've reach a hundred followers you can no longer track the accounts that you need to followback. I think it would be better if we can easily track or check it. But over all everything is so great. Congrats! ❤️Why does the cursor change automatically to random places when threading? I bring back the cursor but it keeps going back to mid sentences as if INSERT button is turned on that eats up the rest of the sentence as I keep typing.Needs more functionality to compete with other social platforms like direct messaging and searching for anything other than accounts. Currently, the app is down for many people and there is no logic to why it went down. That is surprising and disappointing for such a big corporation already rooted in social media like Meta.The app keeps crashing whenever I'm trying to reply. Additionally, Idk if it's because of the phone or what but I cannot see what I'm typing, I need to close the keyboard to see what I wrote and continue.Just change the logo. Pls. I don't know why but it's freaking me out. Everything is OK about the app except the logo. I don't like it at all. Giving 3 rating just because of the logo. If you don't change the logo, I've to uninstall the app at some point.Overall, it looks clean. Though it would be nice to have a collaborative feature where users can do a space to talk and share ideas in the future. Also, maybe we can have an option to create a separate account for Threads and not require an instagram account.It is new and good but one thing is why doesn't it have our same following and followers number as Instagram also about translations we can't translate the foreign languages like Instagram and also switching accounts like in Instagram I have about 5 accounts I can't use all of them in this app still discovering ot well 😊 I appreciate if there is any solution for this pleaseIt won't even let me in when I go into the app, it wants me to enter an 8 digit number backup code, and it sends a text with a 6 digit code, so I can't even get past that screen.It is a good app and overall good concept but I guess it is better if u add chat option and stories with the new updates. This is just the beginning. I hope we will see good laterI can't even use it. as soon as I open it, it starts to bug or something, all the pages and post are overlapping. I can't even reed or interact with anything.Very certain in it if they provide and maintain what Twitter has achieved through these years, perfect timing for it. Able to use Insta ID's is such master move. Loved it. Congrats and hoping it to be bigger than any other platform. 🤍Not so great an app. Basically same with twitter and you can't download videos or DM. That's why tiktok stand apart the flexibility and interaction is unmatched.It has nice interface. Simple and elegant.minimul look with some refreshing features. Quite impressed with thread. Keep improving guys. And well done.Great app But hey i am having some problems hope you improve them 1. Please block all Policy breaking tread Writers . 2. If it is possible that we also can see what Posts Others are liking then it would be great like We can see in twitter. 3. A seperate counter for what is going treading now ...on threads app Like trending hashtags ... trending post ... trending Video etc . 4. App is crashing .....after a little using this app is crashing.i am using xiomi redmi note 8 mobile.It doesn show the replies in posts. It shows something went wrong. The only screen that works is the wall, for all the others it shows something went wrong. How possible a giant company makes such a trash applicationIt's just like twitter I guess but the glitchiness is making it almost completely unusable. If I could upload a photo of what it looks like I would. It's headache inducing.Damn ! It's so simple to use , i feel this is a game changer ! Twitter is not bad but a little complex ! But here on threads it's supper simple ! Attractive look , beautiful experience out there ! Highly recommend it be used by all ! Setting up profile was super simple ! Loved it ! .....sorry to say RIP TWITTER......🥲, You will be remembered!We cannot crop the photo, could not upload then high resolution pictures. It suddenly not working. Overall the concept is interesting.Okay so far needs to fix some issues. I'm sure they are already hearing about all of the features that are missing but I'm actually having issues with gif uploads. When I upload a gif it glitches bad, turns it green and purple with 4 overlays of the same gifi'll only rate 3 stars because we can't save photos here. i wish you can add the saving photos feature here and it'd be very nice, until then i'll have to rate you guys 3 stars. that's all. overall great.Almost two hours of background usage on a day I used this app at most 5 minutes, same happens frequently with Facebook and Instagram so I end up switching the to Restricted Background Usage... Meta data collection is really intensive apparently.There is no search function, so it's impossible to find info by topic. There is no chronological feed, so it's impossible to find very recent news. For example, Trump's valet was just arraigned, but searches for \"valet\", \"Nauta\", \"Waltine Nauta\", etc, produced no info, so I had to go back to Twitter to get the current info.it's cool and new but I couldn't change my profile when I try to, it won't change to dark colors profile pics and I even tried to import my profile from Instagram to there but it won't let me change, it doesn't say anything but when I refreshed it it doesn't upload, I tried to change the profile to some brighty purple and it worked but I want my original photo that I like to be there not the bright purple one, please fix it. thank you!I downloaded this for the first time which is today, the problem is it keeps glitching... I already reinstalled this app 3 times and whenever I open it, it still glitch like the whole screen of threads is glitch that I can't use it at all. Please fix this asap.Very nice app, but its missing a few things such as switching accounts, hashtags, taking pictures, etc Its very smooth and well optimized, unlike instagram for Android which is ironicThis is the beginning of something big. But I think there's somethings missing on the platform that will make it more user friendly. such as; 1. \"Trending news\" lemme name it as \"Trend Threads\" 2. For android users too we can't go through the albums of your gallery, you just have to scroll till u get to the media you would love to \"Thread\" 3. There is no \"hashtags\" Please fix them for us e trust you 👍💯🙌Installed the app. Then, I couldn't even create an account. You can only log in with your Instagram account. I neither have nor want an Instagram account. I was hoping this would be a viable alternative to Twitter, but I guess not. Great job Zuckerberg, you really missed an opportunity here.Terrible. Because of Instagram's overly cautious account policy, I think Instagram itself treats Threads as a 3rd party app and because of it I've been getting constantly logged out of Threads as well as Instagram despite they are designed as intertwined apps. This is such a huge failure on Meta's part yet again. Please fire the development team of Instagram and stop with overly cautious log in policies.So far I am loving this app, but it really needs an EDIT option so we can go back and fix typos. We all make them sometimes and it sucks having to delete and rewrite a post. Please, please, please add an edit option 🙏This app is awesome already, but I do have a few suggestions. First, you should be able to like a thread when it's shared to an Instagram story, either by having it redirect to the threads app or straight from the Instagram app. Second, you gotta make it to where you can search for threads using keywords. Instagram has hashtags, so you could even let me search using those. Dodge and weave those lawsuits ! 😛🤔🧨😈Not working, as soon i touch ut to scroll it a little, it washes the screen with words like when you scroll very fast and never stops just have to close the app then.Wow! I can't believe. This is really a fantastic and user-friendly application from Meta. Perfect application for Instagram users. Meta really satisfied us with this gorgeous application. Just gorgeous! Highly recommend it.Pleasantly surprised, I actually am enjoying it. Gave up on Twitter a while back and seems like this is an easy to use alternative. Not perfect, but it's brand new so I expect that. Give it a try (and delete twitter!)Not the Twitter replacement I hoped for. Feed is full of algorithm-chosen randos, can't limit it just to the people you follow, it's a privacy nightmare (read what it ties to your account), you can't delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account, and no sign of the Mastodon integration.It's full of spam of accounts I don't follow and are not even related to the ones I do, is extremely annoying to a post of one of my friends and another 20 of strangers, blocking and reporting should be easier and once done should automatically mute that person's threads, and above all is no dark theme, so far not liking it at allIt's awesome , a minimalistic twitter , no bugs , smooth app . It's just that the like , share , comment buttons not on the right side since I'm right handed . But overall I love itAs soon as I login it started acting weird and every pages loaded on each other,what a bug or its a crash ? Even reinstalling can't fixed that , please solve this issueSmooth very nice. I have suggestion, please add hashtag search, so we can find others thread whos using those hashtags. And maybe link? With the device browser popup, dont use threads browser popup itself, So we can easily login or approving login api's when connecting on something. Because the caches or data history is only on our device browser (chrome or firefox etc)For a version #1 , this is a fantastic app. Needs some more features to make it a daily app for me, such as chronological view of posts from only my followers vs an algorithm that is now feeding me NFL and MLB and other posts that I have no interest in.I have never liked Twitter UI and it's interfacing and now after using threads it's really app that can replace Twitter because in Twitter the pages load times are too slow and it's unreliable too. Thread is great 👍.Pretty decent UI so far, but checking other people's profiles take a bit before they load. But overall, it's a pretty decent experience. It's not as filled as Twitter content-wise, but it will get there soon enough.Having rendering issue.. the app opens well but the moment I tried to scroll everything collapses ... It like every text overlap with each other.. How to fix it ??Without a proper search function I don't see why this would even claim to contend with Twitter. It took me 10 minutes to lose interest. Might be useful for following friends and idols, but then why another app. Meta has a bunch of them.While the app is a good one,I can't post media on it,anytime I try to post pictures and videos,the app just closes... It's frustrating!!Bad experience I think. It's been 5 days of use of thread 🧵. I have got alot of problems using thread because we can't save photos here we cant enter and give a long space here that makes a problem. Along with that there are alot of problem this app can probably replace twitter in future 😔 yea I am also sad a out that but watching it's exponential growth over days I can easily predict it's potential in market. I hope thread can solve challenge user facing and makes a good user experience ✨Looks clean for now but it has lots of bugs like when to try to increase or decrease the volume of a video it's doesn't work if you refresh sometimes app creashes feed refresh is very slow.. but hope it improvesGreat app, Inside a thread need to minimise padding between 2 threads, overall the whole theme seems to be too much dark, can add other tones as well like Green, red, blue to create some dynamic feels. Overall Great appApp is very unstable. The words in an entire screen mesh in the worse way possible once I scroll down through the threads. Can't even read anythingWorks well and is good looking but as a competitor of Twitter lacks functionalities. The search function is useless except for finding people. And I am not getting suggested threads based on my interests. The app is too basic atm.fold 4 english review: works ok on fold but locks into only 1 oriantion when on the inner screen. when using it in dex complains that some dex features will not work. general thoughts: instagram with option of only text posts? there is no # hashtag searching. no searching for topics. as a social app its kind of hard to be... social.Honestly, I haven't had many issues. I do want to see more functionality on this app. When I hit play on videos the sound doesn't play.This app is a great throw back to old school Twitter. Highly recommend this over Twitter now. The algorithm shows you things you want to see versus Twitter which shows you paid users first. Over all and exciting challenge to Twitter that I'm all too happy because part of. You also cannot pay your way to being seen over others making it more fair than twitters current system.Well Great Execution may be a copy 2 Twitter but looks quite intresting... Of course some developments yet 2 b done like - 1) Increase d word limit in bio coloumn 2) It takes lot of time 2 post any thread 3) Multiple options in COLOUR & FONT makes more attractiveI think when we get better functionality like the ability to only see posts from who we follow, and maybe edit abilities, it will be great. The potential is there.Idk if the app has an issue or if it's something else but I know people I have been following have been making posts and I do not get any mobile notifications about anything related to this app at all, other than that first impressions of this app is it's pretty decent for using it for only an hour plus no rate limit is nice 😂. Fix the mobile notifications or help with making them pop up and we're good to go here!Meh, there is a lot of other threads that i have scroll past to find people I follow. Adding those accounts to the block list doesn't diminish the amount of unwanted theads. The plus side is that if you have a pretty extensive sponsored ads block list in IG, that was carried over.so far so good. the app has been running very smooth since day one for me. there's still more features that should be implemented but overall pretty solid.Not somethings I would expect from a giant like Meta. I'm aware that the app has been out for literally 2 days but all the contents of the screen started glitching as soon as I got to the \"home feed\". I can provide more information if the dev team is interested.Overall a good experience and I think it has the most potential for getting Twitter's place. A quick feature request: - Please add RTL languages support.The app sucks. The navigation is terrible, as if you were on a poorly-designed web site. It also sucks that threads dot net cannot be browsed like Twitter or Mastodon or Reddit or etc. Please stop pretending that Threads is not a web site and that your app is not just a half-a§§ed web browser.I like it a lot. Especially in terms of a clean UI. But maybe if you can make multiple account choices and also the Pin featureAdd auto translate since an app like this is more likely to letting people from different countries socialize with each other. Just keep improving! I'm boutta leave the other app cuz they ask for money to get extra features. 🥲This app has filled up my timeline with profiles I don't even follow! It defeats the whole purpose of \"following\"🗑️ I'm going back to twitter. If this is not changed, I'm deleting the app altogether. Nonsense!Hope there's more option to access my media like using my phone's integrated albums app. It's kinda hard to add older media since I have to scroll down my whole gallery.Just new face behind other! 1 . Its just a new look behind insta . 2. All apps r attached to each other, fb and insta . 3. Probaby security and reporting system would be same and i am already blocked on fb and getting threats to lose my insta . So it will also be more like threats than threads. 4 . U cannot log in through google. And it cause u to make a new profile, after making it, it says passwore incorrect or user not found. 5. Alot more needs to develop. I cannot restore my fb accoun.Trash. Your feed is randomized, so good luck reading the messages of the people you follow or vise versa. It's an algorithm based monstrosity to further put obscure creators in the dirt. Everyone influencer is racing to get followers via the randomized tweet (or whatever) display. I want to support fellow artists, not be subjected to more hivemind monotonyI'm not sure why I'm seeing posts from accounts that I don't even follow on the app or Instagram. Is it a function of the app? Frankly, I don't like it. I'll give it 3-star for now because I love the UI design — it's simple and easy to navigate.The interface has miniclones of itself all over the place and they are overlapping each other. Can't see anything clearly.The second I tried using this app, it started glitching so bad. I tried restarting my phone and even the app itself but it still happens, can you guys fix this ? I would really like to try this aoo without all the glitches.Ok, descent , page design is not that good, yeah can do better, include double tap like, and it seems so many threads at one place, improve,... Btw app motive is goodSimplicity at its best! I love how simple the UI is whilst providing a peak User Experience! I'm not even going to lie, this is easily the best social media product that has come out in years.Overall better than Twitter It's missing a couple of minor features that make Twitter a little bit better like your header but past that it's basically the same but better because elon's ruined the Twitter platform. Apparently there's some bugs that you should be aware of if you go installing this. I haven't experienced one.App is Amazing and I'm happy to use this.As Qa engineer I say that user experience is good.. But There are some bugs in App please fix it soon as possible Ex:- While writting ur bio clear and rewrite then it effects to previous sentence.. I have recorded a video..I hate that we need to login with an Instagram account. I don't want an Instagram account, poorly developed!!! The proper way to develop this is by creating a main Meta account, and using SSO to login each app. In your Meta User settings, the user should be able to choose which apps their Meta account can access, so they should be able to activate or disable FB, IG, Horizon, and Threads.This is a really great app! No wonder new users are growing exponentially. Word of mouth advertising is the most trustworthy. Thanks for the tip! Threads is a God send after the train wreck that is now Twitter.Doesn't even work anymore, it was fine for about a week but at some point I could no longer see my own profile or activity, it just says \"something went wrong\" I reported it but that black box of a user support system doesn't even inform me if the report went through and no reinstalling the app didn't workIt's quiet pleasant. I really hope you are open for more improvements such as a button for media so we can see our photos/videos related posts. Or likes button so we can see our liked posts. Also I hope you add hashtag feature for the future improvements.I was really enjoying this app but now my home page is continually loading. It hasn't updated for about a day and a half. Hopefully this will be ironed out within time but for now, I'll stick to other (working) social apps.Firstly this is not an standalone app [that's not a problem for me] Second one is about hashtags. This app is not like twitter. Twitter is a world of hashtags. But in Threads ,there is no way to create or use tags. Also need translation button🙂.App's interface is great and there is no lag to use.It's super buggy, i can't see anything much because the graphics/lines/texts, smears on my screen...the only redeeming feature i like was syncing contacts with my instagram accountA good start for Threads. However, I would like an option in Threads where my feed displays content exclusively from the accounts I follow and not to be overwhelmed with posts from celebrities whom I don't follow. And probably see what's trending at the moment. 🩷This app run poorly or is it only applicable to certain android models? There are many glitches, bugs, and incorrect bahasa spellings in several places (fine when i used english) i hope it gets fixed soon because this platform seems enjoyableso far so good. a few days ago the app would keep shutting down, but uninstalled and reinstalled and that fixed it. Gotta add a way to go back and edit threads for spelling and revisions. Once its posted no way to change/modify what u posted...😕I am using on Redmi 6A. It's compatible with my device according to description but when I installed and opened it after creating the account when I tried to use it whole the screen gets blurry with text as I swipe up.1. App is awesome 2. The only reason of mine for giving 3 stars is that it's not showing the posts of accounts that I follow on Instagram.Some random posts are coming even though I uninstalled and reinstalled it several times.Please fix this!!My just created account got suspended right off the bet before I even saw a single thread. Sending a confirmation SMS does not work. You cannot delete your Thread account without deleting Instagram. Then I saw they want access to pretty much ALL your data including financial, health, shopping, etc Don't expect this app to be in the EU anytime soon for a good reason.This app doesn't have a lot of basic features. Plus a huge flow in UI. See when typing a reply to a thread, the text box goes behind the keyboard. Just add hashtags.Somehow, my threads app works now. Wow. Check my edit history to see screenshot of how it was. Now, using the app, it seems to be solid. Feels like instagram with a different skin on it. I dont dislike so far. Will continue to use and will update my review in a bit.So far it's been pretty OK. My feed is nothing but celebrities I do not care about at all and none of the people I follow. Seems to be no way to toggle that yet. Once that becomes a thing, I might raise my score. Having no ads (yet) has been lovely but that'll last *maybe* two days.Great application. Please do not run ads. We also hope that the messages and updates feature will work in a distinctive way. Thank youThe app is lagging a lot. The screen freezes at first then all the texts gets overlapped. Images are displaying fine.It would be nice if we had a \"For You\" and \"Following\" tab on the homepage. We could also make the scrolling animation smoother, like on Instagram, and add a trending page.It's pretty simple and user friendly but it takes back to insta for some settings. I think that's a bit annoying.After the initial installing phase i had the option to add my Official Instagram followers by confirming thier requests ... but after restarting the app that whole thing got disappeared i am not able to add to see the comfirm requests button in the notification centre of this app....either fix this bug or else clarify this that was this a unwanted errorIt's showing some weird glitch effect, tried installing multiple times, after opening the app n scrolling the text is glitch n it just looks like a very low fps video, waste of dataTheads ! A unique name with a new experience by Instagram,it's crazy and easy to use because of attachment of Instagram account,which access people easily. And it's amazing.Like most social media apps, it constructs your feed of ~30% your followed accounts (the content YOU chose to see) and ~70% suggested nonsense. If you give me the option to turn suggested content off, I will use this app constantly.I like it so far. It would be nice to have drafts and the ability to deactivate our accounts without deleting our Instagram profile. Edit: Also please separate the people we are following and posts from suggested people because it is quite annoying.Never seen such a glitchy app before! It's lagging continuously, cannot do a single scroll or even see my own profile page. If this doesn't work in next few hrs, I'm certainly deleting it 🤬🤬Can't create an account with the username I want - users are obligated to have an Instagram account and log in with it (I don't use Instagram). Whenever it updates to allow for new account creations, I'll change the rating because I'll actually be able to use it then.Extremely unresponsive. As soon as I open the application, the screen scrolling gets crazy and absolutely unreadable.As soon as I open the app, my screen starts to flicker and freeze and the words just get overlaped of all the options I click into. It's wierdFirst of all, great app. But when I try to upload gifs, it gives a weird colouring for it. Its not that clear and that is kind of annoying. Please fix it.Finally a good alternative to twitter. Looking forward to feature upgrades and tweaks to the apps but it is a great start. Can we please have a dark mode!!I got all that glitchy screen. Duplicated text all over my screen when i scroll down or up. I really want to try this app, but i can't. Unless, it will be fixed.absolutely love using threads. It has made connecting with friends and family so much easier and more convenient. The user interface is intuitive,I highly recommend it!Lacks:Editing features for images and videos before posting. No option to turn off video autoplay. Needs a data saver features.Good app. What i dont like : 1. The send button when comment is in the bottom, it'll be better if its in upper right corner. 2. No dark mode 3. Hard to see if someone already follow back or not 4. Cant translate 5. Cant save photoUnable to curate your feed. Just a lot of random posts from people I don't know. Basically Instagram but with the caption above the photo instead of below.Threads, an Instagram app is made good by Meta Social Platform. But, it doesn't needed the same copy like Twitter. You could better try a rare home page looks on the app. It's just my suggestion. Anyway, Good for posting tweets and much thanks that we could login by Instagram account.I really didn't like the app, first of all it's not working. Lots of glitches are there..not be able to post or see any post.....and i really want to delete it without deleting my Instagram account 😭...both accounts are linkedI logged out to create a second profile, but now I cannot login or create a profile. Keep getting an error message, and then the app crashes. Please help!Can it be more user friendly for someone who wants to thread photos/ videos without scrolling all the way down? It accessed the photos/videos but can it detect the folder/album system of the phone. I hope the new update have this.Something went wrong. Please try again.\" It keeps showing up after signing in with Instagram. After six hours still nothing to see what kind of app it is and what is going on there. Need your help.The application is already good but to see photos or videos that are posted/liked is still difficult. Hopefully later it can be given the feature...It's new but it needs you tell. The ability to save pictures and gifs. And separate from Instagram some not everyone wants all their apps connectedNot ready for primetime yet. Can't browse media folders from within the app. Only your main camera app folder is available. For me at least, I am unable to post videosThis is a very good substitute of twitter, but there are some features if you you add them it became complete, like switch account without logout, and puse auto play video.its a new app need improvement like instagram double tap to like and all that things, option to upload or see ultra hd content, data usage controller and all other things.love it, just want a dim mode and more privacy options (such as being visible to both your followers and people you follow or being able to mark specific posts/replies and public) so engagement is easier and safer, rather than just being cut off if you're on private.So far so good. Fast and simple UI. I hope this app can last long. Please don't end up like Twitter and Facebook. To many ads and complicated features.The debut revealed an easy-to-use, intuitive user experience that easily integrates with Instagram. I started by searching “Threads” in the app store, scrolled through some small apps unfortunately also named Threads (RIP to those, inevitably), and clicked on Threads by Meta. The app asked me to connect my Instagram account to sign up, and I switched over from my personal to my professional page – sorry, readers, I will not be revealing my finsta here. Et voilà, I became a ThreadsReally wanted to like this app, but you cannot post GIFs, yes I know about installing a GIF keyboard I've done that, and one tells me Thread cannot support an image here and a other the GIF isn't animated and a other the color is all distorted, so 1 star, won't be hanging out here muchI'm really enjoying the app but I have a problem, my action is always blocked and anytime I try to add a photo before I post the app closes by itself. I don't know why it's happening but I wish you solve it, thank you.Waiting for connection, Download will start once connection is restored- It says. Connection is fine, apart this app getting downloading rest all things which requires internet works fine. 😊. Will update the ratings, once am able to download. Done.. ok. Updated review.Pretty underwhelming experience and with quite a few bugs. Seems like a rushed release to me. FB need to be more responsible to its user base.Overall good experience, simple. Hope they add more features soon, specially the global search, trends and \"just following\" timelinewe can't search for words bc only accs show up. the timeline is full of people i DON'T follow. no trending list. no bookmarks. please add following page where i can only see my followings' posts. OH and please make this app separate from instagram. we need to delete our ig to delete our thread acc? RIDICULOUS. if u really want to beat twitter, do all the things we say. i also tried posting a gif, but the app ruins it.pls add edit button 4 pics. we also can't save pics...? oh u'r done DONE 3/10DO NOT SIGN UP! If you for whatever reason do not like this app, you cannot delete it without deleting your entire Instagram account. They become permanently linked. It is a total trap!Although the app definitely has potential, the privacy policy is insane and Threads takes WAYY too much personal data. Update the privacy policy and stop monitoring browsing history, finances, and health and the app will become much more user friendly.The app is crashing sometimes when checking replies, blocking following and following back ( it keeps getting automatically canceled then a message pops up ststing that this is some sort of a limitation)Great App! Reminds me of the early days of another app. ;) If you're looking for something new, it's the place to go. Love the Clean/Minimal UI. Looking forward to the future of the App.The app is amazing, I really loved it but I am having issues change the mode of the app. It is only on dark mode on my device and I don't know how to change it backFacing some issues such as the app eventually getting closed. Issues while writing captions, app getting closed on its own because videos are posted and so on.Glitching, I did not set it to upload my Instagram information when it asked yet it did it on its own. All the threads I posted through the day are all gone. And I got a notification that the one thread goes against their rules, how? It's the same stuff I would post on Instagram.Not able to share post in it using the attachment..... After the file is attached foelr the post the app get's shut down immediately...... Tried reinstalling, cleared the cache and data too but not working 🙁THIS APP IS SMOOTH. but for now, i’ll give you 4 out of 5 stars, because we need update with the timeline. please create two timeline, first is like for you page (include all of account) timeline, and second is following (mutual only) timeline! also maybe you can add the features DM in this app! 🥺 anw i’ll give it 5 stars if we get that kind of update 🥰Very smooth app, loving it. I keep seeing accounts I don't follow, even on Instagram on the \"Home\" page. This needs to be fixed.3 stars FOR NOW. its very obvious you guys rushed the release of this. Im gonna change this to 4 after you released: Media section in profile, Direct Messages, Following feed, Hashtags and the option to zoom in on images using two fingers.An Instagram account is needed for use. What a waste of time. 🙄 I would have signed, but I don't need or want an Instagram account again. Why make it mandatory? Why not just redesign Instagram if that's the case?This app is awesome! At one point, society had an app that had a picture of a bird, a lot of angry people, and a lot of bots. Can't remember what it was called, cause on 7/5/23 everyone uninstalled it. This app is essential for any business owner, independent contractor or influencer. The new gold standard for thread based social media!I've not created an account I just wanted to get attention with the 1 star. I was wondering if its possible to create an account without linking Instagram acc? I don't wish to share information across platform and also would like to remain anonymous on this app. Also there isn't an option to create account without agreeing to Theads terms and conditions about tailoring/sharing information. Will these be available in the future?This app would be good if it actually let me attach media to my threads, but the paperclip icon is missing, so as an artist this app has been rendered completely useless.This was definitely needed as Instagram had become boring. Only request would be to make this app available in parallel apps so that people with more than one account have easy access and won't have to login and logout everytimeVery good but there are so many bugs like when you delete a written word the whole sentence is deleted and it is a new app so it is normal that there will be bugs I hope that all the bugs are solved.Quite nice so far, definitely a more nicer place than twitter, could perhaps add stuff like DM'S, Seeing threads that are relevant to you (like a for you page) and maybe allow the search bar to be used to search for certain threads instead of just users? Ik the app just came out but those are things I definitely would look forward to see, I've had only great experiences so far, lots of potential to be amazing. I Do think it sucks that u have to delete your insta to delete your thread accountThreads is a very user-friendly app. All that I don't like is that the app doesn't manually allow you to change it to dark mode.So far so good, but I wish I had more control over who/what topics are showing on my feeds. Also the scrolling on my phone feels slow. Let's see if it is really the \"sanely-run Twitter alternative\" as Mark said it would be.Things that you guys should add in future update. • Theme change/Apperance • Option to edit threads • More organised notifications • Name should display in feed not username • Date and time of threads • Draft • Direct Message (DM) • GIF • Double to on image to zoom in or out • Hastag • Option to save images • Count of threads, replies and likes • Taping profile picture to expandNot working properly, as you scroll it's UI looks scattered, it's not possible to use it for even a second.\"Login with Facebook\" is not an option? Can you imagine if Google launched a new app, allowed you to login with a YouTube account but not a Google account? No? Well, now you understand how dumb this app is. Also, not every user is going to want to be on their phone, forcing people to use an app, so you can collect more data, is shady.It's a nice app, but is there seriously no way to see trending content? I prefer to use Twitter by going through my for you and the trending tab, as just looking through all the tweets of those im following gets boring and repetitive.Abruptly crashes during use. Also, this is like an incredibly toned down bare bones Twitter. Should've waited a few more weeks before rolling it out. People will leave at the same rate that they joined if critical features like hashtags, DMs, trending, platform search are not added immediately.Loving the new Threads app by Instagram! I have to say, Instagram has really outdone themselves with this one. Threads is a fantastic addition to the Instagram family, and it's quickly becoming my go-to app for connecting with friends.The feed was slick and easy to read, though for now it was populated largely with accounts I did not yet follow or care about – perhaps an issue that will resolve itself as more people sign up. ....It's a good start, but the notifications don't work very well. I don't get new post notifications, only replies, which is less than helpfulTerrible collapses everytime I try and post a picture tried several times throughout yesterday and this morning. Reinstalled app and still doing it. Not much use to me.The whole app becomes distorted as soon as i touch the screen after opening it. can not scroll, click anything let alone use the app.I try to install and syncronize with my ig but the launch is not smooth.. I cant refresh or change fiture in ease bcs it will sharing and the screen got shadowed.. I was like seeing a messing screen..For first experience, the app is good. Maybe later could you please add inbox/DM feature, and section for media (pics n vids) in profile section together with thread and reply. Please add section for media so we wont need to scroll so much for pics we upload. Thanksi know the app just got released but it would be better to have save image option, seeing qrts, bookmarks, and timeline for following since the timeline is very messy right nowI'm getting too much bugs in this app I'm unable to view anything on the app its too disgusting that the app is having a bug which is multipliying of the texts its like dragging the entire text multiple timesI know it's a new app and updates will be made. But the app keeps closing anytime I try to comment and sometimes when I'm starting a thread. Aside that nagging issue it's a pretty great app.Needs to sort out: saving media , seeing the people who reposted, the amount of reposts, bookmarks, autoplayimg media, etc. But it's still a great start.This app does not render properly in dark mode/night mode. Every time i scroll the previous content is still there, and it keeps on doing that.It's like Instagram except it's text instead of pictures, except the times you use pictures with text. Either way, it looks like Twitter. Instead of cloning somebody else's app, you should have just made your own. Social media is stagnant and Twitter sucks. Why would you think we would want another Twitter? Give us sync for Reddit comments and features mixed with Youtube, mixed with Instagram, and leave us alone. It also collects your data more than usual. Mark should pay us to use it insteadSo far things are normal. simple ui and faster loading. Nothing boring. Request to implement a light mode apart from Dark Mode. Loved at first sight 🤩Better than twitter. Free from the absolute mess that it's become. Do you remember having issues with Facebook or Instagram? Me neither. I expect none to arrive with Threads either. Twitter however is currently unusable. Full of bots, spam and right wing conspiracy nutjobs.First of all I don't understand why we need another social media app. It is mixture of instgram and twitter so I don't like this app . We already have separate apps too . please stop making these kinds of apps and make better knowledgeable apps for students.I don't know how this is a possible but I'm the only review on this I feel like this app is flawed I don't really get what is going for it's supposed to be a Twitter alternative but the UI is weird you don't see who you're following on your main timeline or whatever they want to call it It only shows you followers not who you're following I can say a lot more but I'm only one person in my personal opinion I think this app is very flawed for nowthe app crashes a lot and it says it has bugs , there is an issue when you try to write in arabic it is not aligned well it show many people that I don't follow them rather than i follow, please remove that , cause it's the main reason why i left twitterGreat app... But I don't really see the point of including media attachments when you already have Instagram. Keep this text-based only.i think you should add features such as for you page (fyp) and following. it's a little boring scrolling and seeing random people's posts. i just hope you'll add those features because it'd be a nice experience especially for me.Refreshing space that does not feels like is trying to force you unnecessary stuff. The way META is tackling monetization and the overall improvement over Twitter latest decisions, makes Thread a worthy replacement for the rest infamous Twitter and the trash show that has become after the new management.Love the interface🙂, looking to explore more features. The remaining star is for the features I'm yet to explore and enjoy. How do I add other threads accounts to my main threads account, like we do on Instagram with our other Instagram accounts? And can we post from Instagram to threads at the same time like we post from Instagram to Facebook on sync at the same time? Thank you in advance for your response .I rate this Application with only one ⭐. Because, I have no account with Instagram, so, If there is no way to Create own account with threads except with Instagram app. Many people can't use this app. Consist of me. Because, I haven't an account with Instagram app, please, brought a unique Idea.I try to upload a picture or video, then the app crashes... Hopefully it gets fixed. Good app anyways, great alternative to Twitter for real.Everything is good in this app, but when I'm trying to upload pic, it crashes. I don't why it's happening I uninstall it and install it many times but the problem remain sameEasy to use your instagram profile and transfer your contacts over with one click. I love the interface, it's clean clear and easy to useTerrible experience, the whole algorithm time line is the absolute worse, i am inundated with thousands of UTTERLY MALIGNANT USELESS ASININE content from\"creators\" that i could not careless if they imploded, i spend more time muting accounts than i do posting anything, i don't care about this new feed I'm being fed, i can't search for content i actually care about, this app as it is, is absolutely irrelevant, that being said the interface is straightforward and posting is easygoing. D-This application is Better than Twitter according to me😍 congratulations Mark Zuckerberg. Best wishes from my side to achieve your goals. I would like to say in this world no one can match your ideas and identity. I am very proud of you. If I will feel after using this app good really I will appreciate you. I think this app will help to some social activities and works. My knowledge is not good about this app but after using this app I am feeling a happy and positive feeling. Thanks &god bless.so far I like it. friendly user interface. similar to twitter with an instagram feel. the search page needs to be upgraded with trends tab or maybe other tabs that can make you engage more 🤷🏻‍♂️Worst experience on threads app. When I open it. It directly crashed. Fix the bugs specially for Android phones. I am using redmi note 8A. App directly crash when I just open it. Fix the bugs.Features forthcoming. This is bare bones moreso than minimalistic, I imagine that there is more to come in terms of options and features.Like it but, I can't post GIFs smh. I hate that new products seen to only allow certain users full access to all of the features. GIFs are almost mandatory on here to make it more entertaining lol. Why not just launch it ALL and see what happens?I am check this application throughout and found below issue 👇👇👇 ISSUE FOUND IN THREADS APPLICATION ISSUE DESCRIPTION:- Threads bio information not updated while user update Instagram account bio and come back to the thread application and click on \"reimport\" button. Expected Result:- thread information should be updating while user click \"reimport\" button from Thread application, Integrated functionality should be working properly.\"Threads\" is a service for friends, family, and coworkers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. People post can be photos, videos, links, and text. These messages are posted to your profile, sent to your followers. In one word it's \"Twitter\".It's fast and smooth, video quality is also nice. Looking forward to the new features they ship out.Can't use the app at all, super annoyed. The pages of the app are completely distorted I can't see a single thing!Threads provides users with a familiar interface that is easy to use. It's basically text-focused Instagram.So far so good. But still a lot of changes is needed to make it better starting from having a home feed that only shows threads from followers and not random accounts.Becoming the first one to review this App on Playstore. The luckiest one. It is the best App ever i have used so far. How lucky I would be, if the compnay announce a reward of 10,000 USD. For me to make me the luckiest one. As a first reviewer of this App. Lets see 😘😜Overall experience good! I got one issue - when i shared the post on \"Instagram story\" by Threads and try to click and move to Threads it's not working, it's not moving on threads page. Kindly please check that! Thanks!It's a good app. It has all The Simpsons future predictions that are yet to happen, terrorist detector, ex stalking feature, completely submersible, and more. I gave it 3 stars because its time traveling feature got me stuck in my previous relationship where I was too complacent and now I can't help it but watch her loving me for my material wishes and even cheating with Thabo, John, and Steve. What a torment 😔. Hope he'll update it so I can go back to the present.Too much noise to signal. What's the point of following people if you never see their posts and only see algorithm suggested posts? Needs to be a follower based chronological feed, not a suggested non-chronological feed.I'm gonna keep it short here. Love it!! I hope there's translation and album selection features like instagram , also a feature to hide certain threads/posts from public? 😅 Thank you. 👀🐒✨💖Threads seems to be the reason why my Instagram has stopped working. As for threads itself, I can't see the replies I'm getting. As soon as I have IG back I'm uninstall the whole lot. The functionality is just terrible.Just made an account and the screen glitches out immediately. Texts overlapping each other, it's a mess. Will get fixed though i believe, but will uninstall it. Wanna send a screenshot, but here is no option. F.So far, so good, but I have a personal account and a public account, everyone I want to change between accounts takes so long and is tedious, it'll be great to add a switch account button like InstagramStill buggy and needs more features, but it's a good start! I like that it doesn't show how many accounts you follow, so it's not about a ratio. Just follow whomever you feel like.It's been buggy and I wish I could select which album I want to upload from instead of ALL of my gallery. I'd love to upload my art but it's tedious to look for my old things because they're so far down my gallery.This app is absolute trash! Zuckerberg can go kick rocks. 🤣 This app is just another way for these elite drones to gather all your info and then control what you say and what you think. Anyone who uses this app doesn't have the mental capacity to think for themselves. It's a joke! Oh, and once you sign up, you can't delete your account unless you delete your entire Instagram account. If I could, I would rate this dumpster 🔥 0 ⭐️. 👎👎👎The best, wow! I mean I don't write reviews but this one one is about making the first or one of the first moves to make a memory relating this app. I predict the app will outshine both insta and twitterUseless unless you have an Instagram account. Cannot see the point of this app. The fact that I cannot use the app unless I log in with an Instragram account which I don't have is just stupid.So far it's more like Twitter than Instagram. It seems like a cut down version of Instagram. With a bit of Twitter. Or the other way round. So far I have enjoyed the experienceI downloaded the app it was all fine... I connected it to my insta account but as soon as I started scrolling it got hanged and smt weird was happening like the app was having some bug... Plzz fix it..Crashes very frequently. On day 1 this wasn't a problem, but on day 2 there's a lot of crashes. Motorola G82This app is stupid, made to rival Twitter but doesn't even stand a chance to Twitter, very buggy, a lot of glitches, and no free speech, yeah, this app has potential but not for now. Just don't waste your time downloading thread. Just use Twitter 🐦Brings your friends on Instagram in Twitter-like format , a dedicated messenger for your Instagram. Simple and familiar interface , still needs some more features to be added.been good experience so far. room for improvement as far some features that may roll out in future. but it is not buggy or slow.I dont want the HOME page to be a cluttered mess of random people I DONT follow having conversations about things i dont care about 🤷 I only want posts from friends and people I actually follow. and I need an easy access to the list of those people. in the mean time... 1⭐️Intially it is good in threads they showing our insta followers threads also it's nice but in tweeter we have to manually follow whoever we want. But initially use it copy text always when we hold for very few seconds and it continues when we scroll down its damn irritating .. please rectify this issue team metahas potential. would love to see chronological order and the option to see posts from those you follow. atm it doesn't really matter who you follow since it's really a small chance you will even see their posts.First time use: crashed while creating a long thread with subthreads with multiple galleries and a storyline. Will revisit once they have ironed out the bugs.This only changes the settings for…. Ready for it, Notifications. Has nothing to do with what is displayed on your wall.Extremely buggy. I can't even scroll without every screen overlapping on top of each other and creating a mess.\"🚀📲 Introducing [The Thread App]! 🌟✨ I'm thrilled to share this innovative app that I've poured my heart and soul into. It's designed to revolutionize [specific purpose or industry], offering seamless functionality, sleek design, and a user-friendly experience like never before. 💡💪 No more negativity or judgment. [Thread App] is all about empowering you to share your passions, stories, and ideas in a supportive and respectful environment. 🌻🙌.Overall app Layout is fire, but app refreshes feed when I'm going through and also i find it hard to turn on sound for videos, please work on itVery bad experience as soon as I open the app it's interface starts overlapping one another and it becomes too difficult to read even a single word .. thumbs down 👎\"Your name and username are synced with Instagram and can only be changed there.\" 🚮💀 So much for trying to get a name that was initially taken on Instagram at the time I signed up then.great app, but please add albums when choosing or uploading photos, i don't want to scroll so far to search for it. Though I won't use this until that was implemented.I'm loving the app, the only fix i want apart from bug fixes is some control/filter over what we see on our feed. I don't even see the threads by people i follow, and don't wanna see random lame meme pages.I don't why I have a problem after make an account everything but when i scroll everything will be mixed and it's seems like my phone is gonna mad and i reopen the app also refresh but after some trys it still same i take a screenshot if here is an option to add i can showDoes not put info from the people you follow in your feed. You get what the app wants to show you and it doesnt do a good job at picking what you would like to see EDIT: Getting betterCool idea in theory, but uninstalling until I can have a home page of only accounts I follow and view posts in chronological order. That's all I want from an app like this.I like the threads app, it's just that please improve it again with a feature to be able to find out who people don't follow us back and, as well as have a dm feature, trending stories and using hashtags. thank you, I hope you read this.I can't attach a photo. Once I selected from Galary then press ok. The app keep on crashing and just went down. Again and Again same situation. Please fix this frustrating issues.The user interface looks neat! But I don't if it's because of the phone's display or swiping is just sensitive on the app that I often select on the text?App need more time to run and not working ki various mobiles. Various glitch occurred while starting. While refreshing the app it mostly lag the application.My problem with this application is that I can only login through my Instagram account but I wanted a separate account for promoting my YT channel and I thought this would be a great opportunity. Apparently not.I accidentally logged out of my threads account, and now I can't log back in. It keeps saying error, that the password may have been changed (I only switched accounts, but ll password change had happened).Really good experience, such a calm atmosphere , slightly boring - need a feature like reels - and a DM feature - and all the people we follow on Instagram to join!So far it has a solid start but once those features and updates start to roll in soon, hopefully it takes off and I'll fully migrate to the app.So far so good. No bugs and feels better than Twitter and only time will tell how good the recommendations are as it learns. Maybe integrate the dm feature from Instagram. Also can we have a single integrated meta login?Some problem are there the moment I log in there I thought it normal when I scroll down for the first time it was lagging like anything letters were floating , I think right now we can't use it properly but i think you guys will fix it nicely.... Thank youI prefer this to Twitter. It works well and follows a similar structure to Instagram. I'd recommend using it, especially if you already use Instagram. This makes it really easy to make an account as you can use the same one.Well at first for me truthfully I don't like it one bit I downloaded it coz everyone around me downloaded it and I fell out of place so o dowoaded it and at first my expirence were horrible I thought we had another app like twitter and blue bird became trash so here is another but when I start using thread I am addicted coz no ads and extra money verification easy to use and your making a account is like cuttuing butter so I definitely like it and we need itCrashes on photo upload every single time. If I attempt to upload a photo from my Fuji X-T5, the app crashes. Phone photos work fine.Very very buggy! If I try to scroll all the info on screen drags and overlays on top of each other. It's unusableIt's the same mentality !!! In face book & Instagram they just give priority in searching and suggestions to sexual profiles which attract teenagers. I think the same mentality is control Threads also. Mark Zuckerberg found his way by using the nudity to increase his Apps users. Recently, I considered Facebook and Instagram as a Sexual sotes and I thought that they may do something deferent in this new app, but it seems no deference. Twitter is my best App 👌Do liked the idea but I'm having some glitch. I can't use the app. The bug need to be fixed soon because I've seen many other have the bug too.I've liked it so far, but if you really want this app to be like the other app, it would be nice if they gave the freedoms that the other gives to certain content or to what used to be face at the beginning XDPretty good launch so far, there aren't any hashtags or an explore/trends tab and you can't bookmark things or pin a post to your profile, but this is a launch of a new app so I wasn't expecting it to be perfectGood start !! When I to scroll down then the pages are clumpsy. I am not able to interact with the feeds if I try to scroll down.I like this app very much...but last night it kicked me out. Everything I try to get back in, it does it again...its frustrating and I don't know if its ever going to let me in.My thread doesn't upload, it's showing, \"failed to upload\", and if i edit my profile, it's showing that something went wrong and not changing, fix the bugs guyssfix the two step verification code generated! while doing two step authentication from my Instagram profile it requires two step verification to which we have to provide thread the 8 digit code but when we recieve code to our phone while doing authentication its only 6 digits thats the major error thread has right now fix this illogical login code generationThey more features a lot more, search like in twitter, not only people, puth a banner in profiles, and separate the Instagram login, so I could make independent profiles also. And much more, but I like this design at least for now, btw too many permission ENOUGH.Very underdeveloped, too experimental, my friends from insta just spams their already existing followers from insta in threads with pointless rambling nonsense, it's like 2008 Twitter but worse. Search function is only applicable for accounts, no real way to search public posts. No dark mode theme.love it and hate it so much at the same time coz we can't just go into gallery from threads suppose i wnat to pin a pic in someones thread i select pin and it just shows all pics from recent we have no option to select from gallery like in other apps we just have to keep scrolling 10000 of pics till we find the pic to pin in....plz let us open gallery our gallery from threads....its really annoying....I think it broke my insta when I installed it, my backgrounds on insta aren't working anymore, also my friend the app just crashes when they try to post anything, it's also kinda just boringThe app works great. I love this experience, but I just updated my password on Instagram and now I can't get back into Threads. Please fix. Thank you.This aps is handy and pretty friendly. If you allowed users to edit and add specific songs to their threads , it would be perfect.A bunch of people I don't follow show in my feed for no reason. So far it's useless spam app with no real purpose. Cannot easily switch between multiple accounts. Nice dark mode though.Showstopper that you can not limit your feed to only those you follow forcing you to wade through all sorts of garbage. Back to the Tw original for now . Can't believe they launched without thisYou need to delete your Instagram account and now, it's getting glitchy and starting to slow down cause of the app, instead of doing it sperately so everyone can enjoy. This is another failure by Mark Zuckerberg. Elon Musk won the cage match. Twitter can't be replaced.Would like to see the repost changed to rethread, then would like to see more content of the people I follow rather than more suggestions, the app is huge and very easy to use, big ups Zuckerberg and the team.Trying to create an account but when I get to the date of birth page I have to step through every month back to the month I was born in. That would be 800+ taps. Not going to happen!!1. When you click to make a comment, the input stays low and covered by keyboard, no way to see what you're typing. 2. Please make users to open and view profile pictures just like Instagram.The plateform looks nice. But as a Threads newbie, I don't expect to see posts from those whom I don't choose to follow. There're too much feeds. Strongly suggest @Meta to limit this unwanted data overload.It's glitching a lot. Resolve this issue. There's some problem with the background, and else everything is good.So far i haven't found anything special in this application, besides it usually shows content from people i don't even follow and that has nothing to do with the topics i've searched for before.Things that should be implemented: - Trending topics - Profiles background image - A \"seek\" button that allows you to see reposts that were made of profiles you blocked. When someone resposts now, it only appears \"this content is not available\" - Search for content, so you can find other people posts - Also a Tab to see the posts you likedIt's like best part of Twitter and Instagram and has , remarkably, a lot of amazing features (considering it's a newly launched app ) . I would like a way to bookmark threads thoughThis app is good but i hope in the next update they add something that we can put back the \"thread badge\" on our Instagram profile, i removed the badge and realized its much easier for my friends to track my thread. Plsss add it so ppl can also decide to remove or put it back huhuWas beginning to enjoy it until I started constantly seeing post by someone I'm not even friends with. Literally every four posts there they are. It's not my page it's their page now I'll check back in on it sometime in the future when more friends are onIt's crashing pretty hard, can't scroll at all and can't make a thread or anything, it just crashes and has a ton of visual bugsToo common app name, lack of uniqueness. There is no option to turn of auto play video. No translate option for other language threads. Lack of creativity, same old appIt has a bug where pages overlap, which renders it unusable. Not everyone is experiencing the bug tho.Crashes when I try to upload photos. Haven't been able to share a single image yet. Will change rating if fixed.I could love this app, if it would stop showing my an bunch of people I don't follow more than the people I do. I DO NOT want suggested post in my main feed. Make it so I can filter them out or completely remove it.Well this was my first day & I'm enjoying this app but still I think there must be some interesting features need to be added like messages, following list at the top, comments rather than replies etc . . . Good effort ✔️It's a \"friendly\" place. Meaning there will be certain censorships. Not only that, but the app keeps personal information. This is just a rebranded Instagram.add a separate feed just for subscriptions and let us choose a general feed by interests or hashtags. i mean, the adds are fine, but not the whole messy feed.very slow and hanging always. could have been better. but having intial launch app it should be better launch with mote adoption and smooth. and not hanging. already disappointed .The app keeps on glitching every time I open it. Even after uninstalling the app and installing it again. Honestly I don't know what to do... Any advice....So far so good, there are certain things I think would be a great help for the users like translations, archive etc. I hope for the app's growth with the growing community.Crashes every time I try posting a simple photo. Happens with both Samsung Galaxy S21 and S23. Would love to see a way to toggle between random posts and those from only people I follow.I just got the app, and it's already crashing every time I'm in it for 20 seconds. I cleared the cache, but I got a message that there's a bug. Please fix it, thank you.Unfortunately my experience is pretty bad. App lags and is unusable. I would post screenshots here to make it clear what's wrong,but there's no such option:(Worked fine for the first two days and then suddenly I can't seem to make any kind of post on the evening of the third day. It keeps posting (uploading) foever.Definitely needs work, lacks some basic features like dms, being able to sort the timeline between for you and following. Right now the timeline is full of checkmarks nobody gives a damn about so scrolling the news feed is like sandpaper to my brain.Instagram Threads is a solid new app that offers a unique way to connect with your followers. It's easy to use and integrates seamlessly with Instagram, making it a great option for people who want to share more text-based content with their audience.Great UI, nice feel. One thing tho is I think we should be able to zoom in on pics and it stays still when we release it.App is crashing a lot and refresh is also taking a lot of time. There is no options to insert gif in the replies.very clean and simple UI, the timeline is not attractive for long time use: i'd like to have a timeline where i can just see the threads of those i follow. maybe have two timelines?Hi, This app is amazing but some feature are not available Missing. I am not download videos and pics & I am not pin my post. please 🙏 add this features in your app. Thank you.I think you guys should add a feature that allow one to know who is following someone and who doesn't please , lastly i tried to comment on a post and it failed to upload which pops on my screen each time i open the app and its so annoying...Thank you..Since I'm not on Instagram, does it mean I can't have a Thread account??Would have been better had it not been a prerequisite....I'm not intending to join Instagram. Make registration through FB accounts an option.everything is perfect. i cannot complain at all but the app keeps crashing after a while it becomes annoying and agitatingComplete disaster. On top of that it doesn't let you take it off of your phone because IG might go too. Doesn't let me upload some pictures and I sent notification 2 times and nothing.full of fake scam profiles, can't select who or what you see on feed. Spend most of the time scrolling and blocking irrelevant profiles/content. Algorithms and ML needed.Too much of the posts that you don't need to see appearing, no way to control it. Too much unecessary and sus data collection as per Data Safety section.Horribly this app requires you to also have an Instagram account. Years ago, I made a wonderful decision to deactivate Instagram and while I was initially keen to try Threads, this is a instant stop sign for me.Very2 simple, and i love the clean look!!! I know this app need to add more features but pls pls pls pls make it simple and not messy like Facebook & Instagram? Pls hear what users want.. Instagram algorithms sucks, so far i love this one.Overall features and UI is good but what I noticed in the app is after Posting thread, the no. Of threads we post is not there so I think it should be there. And no of followers and following tab should be there. And again the app is overall good.So far it's been messy. No option to set the feed to only accounts you follow is a massive turn off. If that isn't updated soon you can expect this to flop like the rest of the twitter replacementsAfter logged into this app , thread ID shown in insta , by mistake I hide that ID but now I'm not able to unhide that , not able to find an option to revert that changes. If possible please enable that otpion OR provide the path for the same !Utter garbage! It doesn't have sign up feature. It lacks 99% of the feature twitter has. It is a bad Instagram alternative.Works on algorithms. It is showing me threads from non follwed accounts as well on my feeds and making it really mess. That I'm seeing randomly from anyone and not specifically followed users.Please remove the option of posting videos. I highly recommend! Then there will be no difference in threads and Instagram. We don't want to see reels flooded. I highly request.When I open this app in my mobile after filling the specified details .the total frame and letters are in jumping from up to down.so by this glitch I can't able to use this app.plzz resolve this problem as soon as possible.Excellent App. I was since long looking for Text based social networking by instagram 😇😘😍 For the sake of Feedback, I miss the hashtag option of Instagram. And the app size needs to be smaller. But still I love Facebook, I love Instagram, I love Mark Zuckerberg... nobody knows the art of Social Networking like Mark Zuckerberg knows...!!!Best app to share thoughts and feelings when uhh are bored while watching reels n all. It's like Twitter but on the same time it's different from Twitter. Over-all Nice experience and must try once.The app is too buggy.. maybe because millions of people are using it right now and it crashed. Now I keep deleting and installing again. Anyone experiencing the same?Very impersonal feeling UI, in it's current state this app feels more like a barebones Instagram copy rather than an extension of it.It merges the aesthetics of Instagram and the functionalities essential and more than enough for microblogging. It's a match made in heaven.Sometimes I can post pictures and sometimes it crashes the app. It'll be better when the bugs get worked out for a new app.Can't post photos or videos as the app will stop working. Can't see any posts from accounts I follow even though I adjusted my notifications. Can only see accounts I don't follow on home page.The app is good enough, but I'm facing some challenges whenever I want to post a picture, the app keeps on closing itself.I hope there will be an update and improvement, such as creating a dark theme. I really hoping for this dark theme, even it's not important lol. However, so far I really love this app compared to Twitter. Thanks Meta.This is an amazing app, I just hope you can Add EDIT OPTION so we would still have the chance to edit some parts if there is any grammatical errors or typos.Disappointing. I dumped Twitter when Musk took over. Wanted to join Threads but because I don't have an Instagram account I can't sign into the app. Deleting it shortly. Sigh! Truly disappointing. 😔This app still needs a lot of development I understand cause it's new, but the android version is quite poor It doesn't have dark theme mode and posting pictures on it does not work.I'm very dissapointed, but I hope this is because this app is very new. I'd like to not see posts of people I do not follow at all, and only in English, it's annoying to come across my native language when I don't want to.Keeps crashing when trying to do a post with photos. As soon as I add one it just crashes out!This app is good but there is no option of google translate. I followed so many people of other countries but due to this issue I can't able to understand the meaning of their threads.Honestly, one of the smoothest launches of a new social media ever? Really impressed so far. The brilliance is in the simplicity and easy community building.Following features is useless! I still saw something that I dont wanna see. Should I block every random post? Feels like spam to me. Your algoritm sucks kinda IG and FB. Adopt by twitter, add features between following and recomendation! So You can add ADS on recomendation features!UI looks clean but Please provide save picture or video option. Also Home feed looks odd. It should show the posts from who we follow or show related to who we follow or based on our locationIt works much better, than other sites, such as twitter, facebook.... It is really interesting websites, what I ever seen, because there you can make your ,,foryou,, what you like and what you are interested in.Very buggy. Crashes regularly. Had an apparent server problem last night that completely disabled it for several hours.Not even 5 minutes in, it crashed. I put in my Instagram account information and everything was fine until I tried to scroll it glitched. Please fix this problem, Thank youThere is millions of bugs and glitches 😑 I've installed and uninstalled. i can't verify my Instagram account they sent verification code over phone call that was 6 digits number but Threads ask 8 digits to verify my account. Where is my another 2 digits of verification codes?? 😅I know it's a new app but it's missing many features, e.g when you're selecting images it doesn't give you an option to select by folder or group name If the pic you want to post is an old pic, you'll have to scroll till infinity to find it😒💔Ok to start. now it's constantly crashing whenever I am trying to write a post. Fix! Still crashing every time I try to write a post. WTH!!It's not working at all it's completely broken, when I scroll the text lines up like a windows error bar in a PC. The app is completely broken dudeHello, I love Threads so far, though I have encountered a bug, I tried to reply with a comment on @Raspberry_Pi thread post, then upload a photo attachment, then threads crashes everytime. So I can't upload an image on a thread without my Thread app crashing on my Galaxy, help :)Only one suggestion is that it would be much better if you add option to save photos to gallery from random post.The application needs a lot of updates. Also, it is bad. When deleting the account, it deletes the Instagram account with it. I hope to amend and thank youPlease I need my Instagram back, I just unstalled thread app due to insufficient space in my phone and automatically my Instagram is not longer opening. I have to delete another app in my phone just to install thread again for my Instagram to be restore. Please mark work on this issue.One of the best design social platform. Make it more easy and useful don't added too much stuff to make it boring. It's just awesome the way it is right now.Really bad experience. It is full of bugs and the screen freezes everytime I open the app.The app works well and I like it so far, but it's missing a few things, like a section for my liked post or bookmarks so I can revisit them. Don't know why they were left out since IG already has them.I love the idea but recently I've been unable to access my followers list. Keep saying I should try again. Its really hindering the smooth flow I was enjoying for the first few days.A lot to fix, the feed is like Instagram which only shows algorithm instead of the last post, it shows more influencer people I don't care than the actually accounts I followed, the dark theme by default is cool.Awsome, a total rip off of Twitter, but cool, but the keyboard seems to do crazy stuff when typing on the posts. Typing special characters and changing the start of it. Seems like you are tracking the thread before it even posted?I am encountering a significant issue when I launch the application. The scrolling animations in the app are not working properly.There is nothing new in this application. If you want it to continue, make new updates to the application, because the first day of using sentences with two dimensions is very normal and boring.Kindly make a mature UI. UX is not good. I think you should think of it again. This doesn't seem mature. Its like new coder have put all the components at one place.Great UI/UX design and simple interface, please add hashtag and trending feature and also try to add something from which user can gain more followers.Improvements I wish they will do, - Don't show posts from people I don't know - Better the search box option. It's not showing results many times.I don't have a problem with it so far except for not being able to translate yet, to me it's a Twitter but without the random nudes😁 I recommend, Twitter is getting old anyways, this is the Gen Z version maybe? 🤷‍♀️Everytime I download it glitches happen and everything overlaps. I've deleted and downloaded it several times hoping it would work but it didn't....Just another app that Meta uses to shove ads, influencers, and top brands down the throats of everyone. I go on the app to see what the accounts I follow have posted, only to get swamped with posts from the likes of the idiot Kardashians, and other brands that I do not follow nor like. It's excruciatingly annoying.I really like this app! It's wonderful! I'm just kind of sad ever sense I downloaded threads I got a bug on the instagram app and now it crashes everytime I try to pull up the app🥲With the death of twitter wanted to try an alternative, however.. There is no way to create an acount in the app. Exclusively for existing Instagram users. There isn't even a mechanism to create a new instagram account.Nice one a formidable rival to twitter. But i think more should be done to sarnitize the app, contents are just allover the place. Getting contents from people i dont follow kinda makes me feel weary. But overall i love the appHas the potential to knock Twitter out of the water, but until I can just see the content of who I follow, it's not usable. That time line is so chaotic it's not fun to read. Why have a follow function if you still see people you do not follow?I dont know if its just my phone of your app, whenever i try to scroll down it will break like all the threads are mixed up going up and down, only the images are visible, so sad.Very annoying that it's pushing a bunch of other accounts. If wanted to see what certain influencers, celebrities or brands were saying I would follow them. Maybe have a trending tab or something else but for general scrolling I'd rather seen only who I follow!Really good app.. Hopefully it doesn't die out soon.. The upload resolution quality for pics and videos are top tier.. Better than any of the other apps that would kill the quality.. Good job Zuck 👍🏽..App Is Crash Now And First Position is static then scroll down screen about all fiction are not working and is confusing. Please Check Out Now This Bug or Error. How To Send Screen Shot ?Far from perfect. Still seeing a few bugs and many features missing such as hashtags and account switching. Main feed is full of garbage from people I don't follow. Still better than Twitter though.Hey! I got a bug. After installing Threads whenever I open Threads, my Instagram DM theme sets back to Default even if I change the theme and open Thread again, it changes my Instagram DM theme back to Default again. Please kindly resolve this bug on priority.The worst of Twitter. It's turned into just the awful For You thread with random shite from random times copy of Twitter with no option just to get stuff from people you actually follow. Gets worse every day as more randoms join, and after 3 days already just annoying.Hi, this apps not running smoothly in android 9. When i open it, the screen like glitch, cant read threads. i will give 5 stars if the problem have fixed.Just downloaded it, have an Instagram that I barely ever use....opened up threads and it's just randoml blue check marks of people who don't interest me at all. It's pure chaos, fix it or just delete itBug on Redmi 6. Screen glitching when doing something on the app (scrolling timeline, switch tab, and other activites that makes move on the screen)It's a good app but ever since I downloaded it my Instagram has never been the same I've been restricted and can't use my Instagram I don't remember going against the guidelines can you please make threads less connected to Instagram it really sucksIt's literally completely broken. You synced my Instagram bio when I said not to. App doesn't load anything. You changed my profile, and now I can't change it back. Fix your appThe app is glitchy. The interface is shaking. Can't read what's on the screen. It's a bug, needs to fix it.I'd suggest making atleast our name changable (idk why, just a random suggestion) and also add a show/hide option for showing/hiding Instagram and Thread accounts, but either way, this is a good app which is way better than Twitter.These are many times better Twitter apps than yours. I will try my best to use Twitter every day. Don't use this and this is a nonsense feature that if we delete this account it will delete our Instagram account as well. I want to tell everyone one thing that this is very nonsense but please don't use it. 💯🙏🏻When i scroll the screen the app will blur and something like glitch effect the font and the image not showing.. I have screenshot but there is not any option to upload please give ur email id there i will send screenshot of error in threads appThe app is very good but it have a glitch in dark mode, whenever I scroll the words get over written, this is the only problem for me, otherwise it's fine.I installed this thread app 2 or 3 times but still it is getting fully glitched if it was pbm of my phone thn whatsApp, insta all shld have got glitched. Didn't like this app . Sorry.. But i appreciate the hard work u ppl have put to make this application.Its a good app though i wish it was just an added feature on Instagram app so i dont have to install another app. Also, I hope you give us an option to delete our threads profile without affecting our instagram main profile 🫶I have high hopes and a very low bar set by... you know. Thus far, impressed by ease of installation and clean interface. Chose to set up clean slate account which I'd recommend until you're sure this is a good add for your \"main\" IG footprintDear founder of Thread Apps. So far I like the look of this app because it's a bit like a *blue bird one.* But, I'm not really satisfied by this apps because there's no pinned thread, i wanna pin something on my profile, so people who's want to follow me know about my account. My advice, please add the pinned thread feature, so it will make it easier for people to find out about my account or my personal backstory. Thank you so much for reading my review, i hope it reaches you.The best social media app! It feels so smooth! This is a combination of facebook and instagram, a lighter, smoother and no limitations!Fluidity of the App is best. It is really stable as if it can easily sync with other META apps like Instagram, Facebook. Just love the new atmosphere of this new social media app. Welcome to the competition! 😜There's still some eror at the apps. Some message can't be see, once I open the message (comment) it crash.Just alright...needs much improvement...I'm seeing alotta thread accts showing up on my feed that I don't follow...seems like the random accts show up when an acct I am following responds to their post or vice versa...would like that to change...might delete since this is a nuisance..It's really good. Can you fix the problem where I want to change the bio or profile? It keeps saying something went wrong. Also, can you add a switch account or create a new profile?The app is awesome. Please design the app logo and photo dark theme is not looking good. Add in-app messages feature different from fb and Instagram Give it different look.What a mess. I only want to see people I follow. I don't care what the other nuffies are up to. You hide the feature in Instagram and on Threads it isn't even an option. Another garbage app from out of touch devs.Is it just me or when i use this app and move the screen the frames multiply and the whole screen gets covered with the frames? I cant even read anything. If this is a bug pleas fix it or is it my phone?Until it becomes a dumpster fire like other platforms it's not bad. Bots are making their way into the platform, and I care not to see posts from accounts that I do not follow in my feed. Would like to see migrated over the translation feature at leastNot measuring up to twitter. The search function doesn't shop threads content, only people . My main way of using twitter was to find out what was going on or what people were talking about in real time and join the conversation... but app does not allow this.It was a lovely experience of using this app. I really like the user interface and features of it.This is a great platform of sharing your conversation.Good app . However on thing we request is to have the translation there. Not all of us read a particular language . If have I will change mine to at least a four star for nowYou must allow the feature of \"following lists\" hear and in Instagram because we can't find them!!. Then, arrange the threads in squares such as instagram posts to find them quickly!my experience Yay I really liked the tutor and I am getting a lot of help here to cheat and very good this platform and I am sure it will be better than a best perform tutor. Would like toThis app is amazing and I've been addicted to it from the start but some changes I would like to see are a following page (I'll update if there's anything else) but I would 100% recommend this appReally good alternative to similar apps. Very clean and nice UI. Really responsive and well connected to Instagram.I gave it a 3 cus it's kind of celebrety application. I wish the Facebook feature \"Suggested friend\" should work on this app in a different way so that people can follow their friends and not only celebreties.Nice app but unlike Twitter, we can't download the pictures and videos. Thats a deal breaker for me. Hopefully this option changes, because this app could definitely beat Twitter.Useless. Basically, it's just Instagram. It's makes no sense. Since it's by Instagram, why can't followers carry on to this? Why do I have to start getting followers from scratch when the app is connected to Instagram? Like I said, it's useless. I deactivated and uninstalled the app.Worst glitch is happening here, can't even explain the type of glitch, but the contents of the screen get cloned everytime I scroll through the app, at first I thought it was my phone but it's glitch in the app itself...I can't open profile picture of others, so i think Twitter is still better, and the UI not perfect, Twitter still better, fix the profile picture and the user interface, and unblock Andrew tate from Instagram so i can use threadsMy experience with thread app is so bad the app is constantly crashing you can't even get a hold of your own feed ... I didn't even got the chance to discover the appi havent had any probs except when im using the delete keys to delete my typos, but the other words gets rejoined together and its really annoying.. hope yall could fix that..and for sure i would live to give yall a 5* !!Good overall experience so far, though it would be nice if there a save button for images so we can save them directlyWell there are several features that I hope available in this app such as data saving (autoplay disabling), media downloading, and trending.Im using android 9 on color os and its overlaying everything. If i scroll it turns into a mushy text biriyani. Currently it is absolutely unusable. PLEASE FIX IT OR LET US HAVE A SITE FOR PC Edit: they fixed the issueSuper great, able to speak the way I wanted, interface is simple and great, hopefully ads will not ruin the experienceAmazing Ads free experience and pure content at full scale. This is what we need. There should be different types of tick for verification of users. Private user, Normal user, content creator and Pro User.Cool so far..2 features I think might separate it from others 1. Like and Dislike button 2. Either a DM for privacy or a locked view message to be seen by only the person you are replying to and yourself...ehhh I would prefer if Threads was a bit separate from IG. keep it separate ie. ig private & threads public and to have the ability to change user name in Threads if possible. I prefer not to be connected-linked to IG all of it.This is not a high quality app. In this, the post of useless people comes to your home without calling you, picture editing facility is also not available in this.If a \"For You\" feature is added, I'd be much happier with this app. Right now, I'm seeing a lot of garbage of which I have zero interest. Trending topics would also be nice in the future.Minor bug in the activity menu where you can't scroll down \"all section\"everything else is. It's a very demanding app. However, its still needs some improvementIt's familiar to Twitter where the difference! But it made an ecosystem with Instagram and that's pretty good 👍 I'm searching for a differentiation to use thread.👉Bio for Threads/Threads Bio ideas: Hey there, fam! Have you heard about the Threads app?  It’s Instagram’s super cool text-based conversation app that’s all the rage right now! Get ready to take your chatting game to the next level with this application. Instagram, is the greatest platform where billions of individuals from all corners of the globe come together to connect, share, and inspire through attracting photos and videos.  Threads!  is like Instagram but for text! Can you believe it?🥰Downloaded this app but I guess you can't open this app unless you have an Instagram account, which I don't & don't want. The app will not go past that page, so there is no way to open an account!??I love threads, but I'd love more navigation (I'm sure it's being developed). Also, today it crashes when I open comments on any post, just a heads up to developers :)UI is really slow and is unappealing. Has a lot of potential, but a rough startThe app is great. However, after a successful installation and it logging in, Instagram app crashes frequently.Great app. Would have given a 5 star but my post keeps failing to upload for 2 days now. Pls fix or drop the android upgrade cos I see ios users talking about the new upgrade that comes with translation and other cool stuffIt's really a good app, but we need button for translation and pause menu on videos, or videos shouldn't be played automaticallySo, I'm wondering ... Is Mark willing to upgrade the trending algorithms? Because this is really a concerning issue. This app is supposed to get data directly from Instagram, and yet a lot of posts in my feed are BS and random! Another thing, since he wants to challenge Twitter, where the heck are the hashtags?The screen is unreadable. Seriously disappointed. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still won't work.ANOTHER GARBAGE FROM META - A copycat app which is launched to compete with Tweeter but it pales in comparison to this app & moreover it is confusing wether it is a stand-alone app or part of Instagram because while logging you have to go through the hassle of logging through this appApp still need work. The screen freezes when I scroll through the app and it looks like a million popup is on my screenFirst two days it was Ok, the third day,Screen acted wierdly as I opened the app. I thought its my Phone's display fault at first. And Another problem is that I am unable to switch accounts instantly just like we do in Instagram.Nice app with features you would expect for a first release. However it does crash to the homescreen after doing actions in the app sometimesYou guys still impose the annoying auto play video on this app just like Instagram, the reason I don't use Instagram, how can you not give us option to turn off the feature? So annoying.Very good app, this app is integrated directly with Instagram so it makes it very easy for me. The UI is also very simple and easy to use. I haven't found any bugs so far, so I give 5 out 5 👍Very poor. My feed is full of rubbish, not from the people I follow. I can't even turn the dross off in the settings. No chance of replacing Twitter in this state 🥱Not a serious Twitter competitor. Feed is littered with content that I don't follow and is not in chronological order. It's the worst of Facebook trying to imitate Twitter without actually incorporating the best part about TwitterTwitter is WAY better! If you don't want to be told what to think and you value your right to have an open, free and civilized dialog, then use the app that supports and encourages it!As a developer and a normal user, the app is really easy to navigate through and also has a simple ui.Amazing app. Still need more features to take people off Twitter. Need to stand alone from Instagram, shouldn't be limited to users of Instagram. I don't like Instagram so much but I love the thread.It's not working in my phone. When I open this app login page appears when in put my email and password for logging in the screen goes blurry.Would've been fine except the forced algorithmic timeline (which basically shows the follows of your follows and none of your own follows) basically ruins the entire appThreads by Instagram is the ultimate mashup of Twitter and Instagram, delivering a captivating microblogging experience with an Insta-worthy twist. It's like having the best of both worlds in one slick app. Prepare for your social life to take off!I found a major bug where it shows white screen 1. Installed the application 2. Switch to different instagram account and click back button without filling any details then it shows white screen Please let me know where to file this?Good clean ui, keeps crashing when attaching pictures or videos. Missing function to privately message someone can be added laterThe app is great amazing well optimitized and very well running but I would like to see other features added such as dms and views on your threads if they do that it would overtake twitter in a matter of days otherwise great appI love it. But it needs more work, more features, and adjustments to show current threads and not stuff from the previous day.Really enjoying this app so far. I do hope there are plans to make it so we can log in to multiple accounts and also a web app as well but apart from that so far so good for me.Reposted a post and when they deleted it, the post went to “Content not available”. The post should've disappeared and not left a mark! It's making my profile look ugly. It's irritating.You should make this app available for Iphones worldwide as well, and make sure you add the switch account option just like in instagram to make it easier to manage two accounts at the same time.i think its a good app, does need work like any other app obviously but we should be able to delete our accounts without having to delete our instagrams if we have it linked it, especially to those who didnt know that rule or didnt read about it (like me)This app is cool but one quick bug on android is the attachment. It quits everytime I try to attach an image/images to a thread.Pretty much excellent start but I wish there was a minor option to just view the threads from users I'm following instead of everybody. Also there is no current way to search for a particular threads.It's all in a language I cannot understand and changing it has not been easy. Just seems like a copy of twitter just not as good. Why would anyone need this when we already have twitter? Why do we need so many social media apps???Please separate timeline by two categories which are FYP and following only (with some filters like show latest thread or show trending). Add a Direct Messages too so people can feel more connected each other. The last thing is create a mark on people who following each other so we can track someone who doesn't follow back or someone who just unfollowed us. Thanks.Absolutely pathetic experience. It keeps crashing. Im using Android phone and it seems that the app is not programmed for itNo longer working. Can't post or read replies on other threads. I've reinstalled, updated, logged in and out, reported it. Still not working.App crashes whenever I try to upload a picture. Tried reinstalling and it did not work. App is installed on Samsung S23 Ultra.Useless app. Once signed in, you can't delete your account without deleting your Instagram too! I believe we should have been informed about it in advanceUnusable. The app full of glitches, it's impossible to read even one post. Only posted photos are visible.lots of potential, needs work. crashes every time i try to attach a picture to a post.I can not see the replies to any Thread, it keeps showing an error. It could be a good app, but is not finished and it shows.Needs a lot of work. Why must I view rando's threads? What is the point of following people if I can't view their threads FIRST? Right now, it is WORSE than Twitter! Why is it so hard to switch accounts? IG and FB make it easy to switch, without having to approve a new login request!No hashtags or ability to search for a particular discussion. Can only see content from people you follow or that gets \"randomly\" recommended. Does not compete as a Twitter replacement, yet.Definitely has potential, but there's a lot showing up on my thread that is not interesting to me at all. Need to work on the algorithm a bit or allow me only to view my followed accountsThere's something wrong w the app, there's a bug, every time u try to post a picture, the app closes itself.Works as you'd expect. Haven't experienced any glitches or outages. Easy to use and navigate the app. Enjoy seeing content.I do hope they could add translator to fans that are international, hard to read some threads that aren't the same language that I use :')) But overall, the app is good :))Can't delete threads account without deleting Instagram! Why does it need so many permissions that don't seem at all necessary? It's literally a copy of Twitter but with more censorship, tracking, and creepy personalized ads.Won't let me follow anyone, 8 days now and the response from Threadsapp team non-existent. Other than that, i like the communuty and the app is getting better, but has a long way to go.Be Advised!! I looked into deleting my Threads account and found this in the Help Section: \"Since Threads is powered by Instagram, in order to delete your Threads profile and data, you will have to delete your Instagram account. Note that we're looking into a way to delete your Threads profile separately. This app is incredibly boring. No way comparable to Twitter.Force closes when I try and post photos. Whether it's a photo I'm posting, or if I'm replying with photos... I'm sure it's just opening day glitches, but booooooo.not a single person I follow shows up on my timeline, just 3rd rate influencers. no option to see only those I follow? also when replying, I can't see my own prompt, the keyboard covers it...It has been synchronized with the Instagram ID, which is very struggling process. I don't know those who don't have insta id, how they sign in to the app...?Amazing App... It's a best competitor for Twitter... But needs some improvements and I think you can add some earning methods also in this app for making it unique and different from Twitter.The only problem I have with this app is you can't choose your username it automatically takes it from your Instagram. I feel like I was early enough to this app where I could finally get the username that I have on YouTube. Or even a username for my band. But I can't because Instagram....App keeps crashing.. won't let me upload photo's also it would be cool if this app allowed private direct messages just like Instagram... hopefully that comes soon too.Just as the rumors said, it's a blatant Twitter ripoff. Absolutely nothing compelling to the interface or the platform. Everything feels very plain and like a stripped dumbed-down version of Twitter, making me feel like I'd rather just use it instead. If they wanted to make a splash and compete with Daddy Musk, they're failing quite miserably right now. Should've fully polished things up before releasing this half-baked uninspired mess.Twitstagram! The Twitter UI is a bit nicer to use, but Threads is very active and there are no limits! Looking forward to the next few months of developmentThis app is not enough. I didn't like it. Because if we log in this app we will be stuck. If you log out from this, you will be logged out from Instagram. You should find a solution for this as soon as possible.It's okeh but bruv, if u wanna compleat add story & ig music with reels too, Incld adding hash tags & music to photos, it would work so much better like fr, don't have any other problems tho, also messaging people too yk, Cos it's kinda hard to use ngl.Obnoxious home page/feed. It's basically irrelevant to follow people on this app as the feed shows you content based on \"the algorithm\" not people you choose to follow.I wanted to check it out but nevermind. The only login option is with an instagram account. I don't want Instagram and will not create an account just for that.Nice app ,but less than Twitter 🙄, let's more improve the app ,team Instagram, only add photo not musics, songs.please improve the bug yaar ... Great app for text but add music .....team @meta,@instagram 😕 thanks..... 👍This app is perfect as it is now please don't add ads or allow bots on this platform, and a final suggestion would be to not add dms in this app since Instagram already has that feature so just keep this app focused more on the threading!When I logged in to the app it showed me a huge bug . The company of the app is need to be solve the problem neither it will be going a huge trouble for the users. Really very disappointing.Great app and I know Mosseri admits that some functionality is missing but I'd really like to bookmark or save threads that are really interesting just like you can on Twitter.I would really like to be able to use more than one account. I have 2 IG accounts, 1 business and 1 personal, but can only use one on the app on my phone by just switching like on the IG app.It is really nice that we have got a media platform of our own expectations 📌 it is a nice app where u express your self and have fun at the same time. All I can say is that it is the best platform I have ever seen. Everyone should joinI am experiencing a blurry display of this App and i cant read the writings and cant see the images. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app thrice but still its not workingVery cool and easy to use. Also love that they don't allow lies and hate with a strong fact checking and moderation system in place.Unable to login because i login every time on Instagram with my Facebook account, i didnt made any id seperately, however i am unable to login through insta when i try to login it is asking about the password of Instagram, now the thing is my password is the same as my Facebook id, when i enter it it is showing as incorrect.Amazing app...and I like it more than twitter...and I hope it can easily defeat twitter...if meaningless policies will no t be made... And the feature...that we can type/write more context in 1 thread as compared to twitter ...which are less... @zuck 👌🏼Very vest of time application, worst experience, copy of Twitter, threads is a Twitter little brother, I deleted threads and all so Instagram, and Instagram like a tik tok 2.0 version, and really rate of both app 100/-1 they are deserving this rate.Twitter was going to the dogs, so I left, this came along, I liked it's ease of use, it isn't a slanging match, I had no high expectations and it's exceeded them easily.😡😡😡😡😡It's been 10 days and i can not post my 64 mega pixels photo's in any way possible it's just soooo disappointing to say that i might regret my choice over Twitter 😡😡😡😡😡 02/10 . It's my 2 dayI hope I can save the picture too just like in Twitter which will make me delete the Twitter app for sure meta please give some thought to my review I hope you guys will understand 🤍 over all i love to use this threads app ☺️ 9.8/10I give this app 3 stars and I gave Twitter 3 stars. The remaining 2 stars will be awarded to the victor of the cage fight and awarded the best text based social media platform. May the odds be ever in their favor.Better than Twitter. Good interface but dark mode, data saver etc features should be added in it. 👍👍👍Need some more features like DM's and a NSFW system so people can enjoy it most. Also, a way to seperate reccomend threads and threads from following. Other than that it's good.Once I open the app, it starts glitching. I have installed and unistalled 3 times now. I can't even scroll the TimeLine or go to profile.Interface was not that good. Slow and many features are needed. I'll give it some time considering this is newMy experience was worst I didn't even wanna give 1 star because whenever I open it there are so many glitchs and we click one thing but we see it's multiple selfs and it's running automaticallyOccasional a particular picture won't load or the sound won't play in a certain video, but for the most part... All goodWhy am I facing glitching issues every time I open the app, i tried uninstalling the app and then reinstalling,then also it didn't work, all i could see was an entire screen full of glitchesEven if it looks the same as Twitter, it's really fun and enjoyable and i'm glad there are no bugs, glitches, lags and other problems on this app. Good Job!Hope there's an easier option to switch account like in Instagram. Crashes every time I do it.The feed algorithm is hell on earth. No features. Pointless and will die in a few months. Was really hoping it would be good and save us from ElonStill learning and navigating but seriously I don't care nor want to discover random people's posts that I am not following on my page. If I wanted to I would search them up to get their posts specifically. Also can't find the posts from accounts that I do follow. Please fix this as this is one of Twitters only redeeming qualities that they have over you.Too good liked the AI and UI of the app 💯 Instagram connection is a great way to enhance the use of both apps. Great reach with least marketing. Happy threading.6Jul23-The only way to get in is to log-in with instagram and I DON'T HAVE instagram. I haven't had it in well over a year and don't want it again. I'll just classify this as another useless app...It's a great app. But i hope it can have a smooth interface when login into multiple accounts like Instagram.I wanted to love it. I was hoping it would be a twitter killer. But it's just Facebook 2.0. My entire feed are people I don't follow. I actually struggle to find the posts from those who I do follow. It's about 1 in 20 threads that are people I want to hear from. It's just a mess.it's good, but, no setting to turn off video autoplay(I really hate this), no option to save a photo, I really hope that threads will just like a twitter, but with no elon on it...Nice social app by Instagram ❤️ , I really liked the simplicity of the app UI and the basic features . Hoping for the new features to drop by soon 🤞.Need to improve algorithm. What makes twitter interesting is their homepage can show the most random yet funny tweets from ANYONE. In threads I only saw influencer or celebrity who \"trying\" to be funny but ending up cringe.This is frustrating, threads? Why can't upload or find explicit contents here. Hopefully you'll consider openning for explicit contents, otherwise this app is lame. Make this app where users can upload any contents they like. ;will go back to twitter.Its fantastic platform for shearing your ideas, thoughts & opinion socially ! In their all functionalities & performance is also best & also it's very easy and userfriendly for use....!!Giving it 4 stars cuz of few reasons. 1 we can't do hashtags. 2 We can't stitch accounts, only we can use one account, and for switching we have to logout and then login another account. 3 it can't show insights of the threads/posts.Videos autoplay should be stopped. One of the reasons we like twitter. If videos play in auto, then this app is a direct replica of Instagram.Cool concept, but not nearly complete enough to even compete with Twitter. It needs some time before it can truly compete with Twitter.The app is acting weird when I scroll, I tried to reinstall, but didn't make any difference. Also, when will threads be available for desktop?Lacks plenty of features, you can follow acclunts in discovery only and your feed has only 1 option which is all random, no other featureshonestly this app ui is very phenomenal, but the algorithm is not right... nothing but verified people in the feed, no good opportunities for smaller people to actually grow on to a platform its just awful i might actually deal with Twitter.Basically just shows a bunch of brands social media managers trying to be quirky. Too much time spent using the mute button to not even curate a desired feed.It's great app ,but alot need to be done in terms of futures of saving pictures ,and alot more .,thanks to meta family ,Am apart you since 2014 on Facebook .I would like to love this app but it doesn't seem to let me add pictures to my quotes. It stops the app and takes me out all together. Am I the only one? I hope they can fix this problem soon 🥺When i upload the attached media (picture) with the selection from gallery use the share button, when the threads's page appear, the picture i selected doing image rotation by itself. What happens?Good potential and nice to not have to constantly be reminded of elons existence, albeit the app is still pretty new so there's still some features in the works but overall I see the potentialNot worth switching from other social media. File upload is a fail and the setup is a disaster. I will change my review if you make this app usable.A stupid copy of Twitter.. Like the rest of the meta thefts in the testicle of Rails that failed in Instagram, think of something other than imitation. This is the reason for Twitter's success. It is distinguished from the rest, and it is better than Insta and Facebook.It's a great experience but the app keep crashing, more that 10times today. Not sure if am the only one experiencing this.. fix itthe immediate update should definitely be about adding hashtag function. also search option should be expanded so we can see not only other people's profiles, but also the content itself and hashtagsThe app is not too stable,please fix META. Its Scattering text and pictures on my Andriod Device. Updated today 17th July 23. The problem is fixed. Thanks META. Please spice the app up lets beat twit.Since I downloaded threads, my instagram app has been crashing. I had to finally uninstall both. Tried installing Instagram again and it has been crashing. Support please help.Threads app keep crashing all the time . I reinstalled the app but didn't work out . Pls remove this crashing or buzzing whatever it is.I want to know one thing that Instagram still underdevelopment, cannot serve ads and start payment for users alike YouTube, and developing new app... First develope Insta fully, so users can earn on insta and value of insta should go up ... People making reels to earn as they are earning from youtube.Hey ,please don't make same color and options like Instagram make it different and use some color with the opening logo. I like the sign up option with Instagram but again I tell you please don't mix insta and thread togetherI've been trying to open this app since last 30 minutes but it's still showing me errors and not letting me login my account and it's telling me to wait for a moment. Idk what to do.This app is mass or nothing whenever I open this app is acting like weird first time I think it's just my phone problem but not my brother has iphone and in his is also this app acting weird when I scroll any thing this seem load anything on screen could you plz fix this type bugs I really need to explore this app do some thingVery poor, working for 24 hrs then everything was \"something went wrong\" can see nothing but the main feed. You can only see what Threads wants you to see. Potential but right now bit of a train crash.Poor, buggy twitter copy but worse than twitter, linked to Instagram account and can't use without one, so will be removed after 10 mins, I'm guessing it's just another way for big tech to steal, sell our data bye byeQuite new app. Have some issues but overall amazing. I'm giving 3 for now. But I'm sure in future they will improve the features so we will give 5 stars.The experience is awesome but it would be great to be able to translate certain posts to our respective languages to understand just like on InstagramDONT INSTALL! ACCOUNT CANT BE DELETED ONCE ITS CREATED!! The account gets permanently linked to your Instagram account and you can't delete one without having to delete the other.I believe after giving permission to mobile gallery, your gallery folders should be grouped as it is in your gallery. It's extremely hard to select contents.I know y'all can fix this, but it's not letting me upload right now. Whenever I tap the attach button, my app crashes. Please fix to update my score.App is preety cool but without including direct massage option i dont thing this app is usefull for anyone, please add direct massage option for making app more effective. Thank you🙏Their is an only one option for login that is Instagram but their is many Facebook user can also try this app and i think that most of facebook user are older there is and some probability they don't have an insta ac if we provide the login with Facebook then uts help.. (We can not avoid some minorities may be this can help us in future)Good interface Nice design Looks like twitter. Cross of insta and twitter But lacks some features of twitter like Translations under threads, don't have trending page like twitter, Don't have short videos like in twitter, Don't have view button like on twitter which shows how many saw your tweets. Don't show features like retweets, quotes tweets, have in twitter.In desperate need of gifs, hashtags, and trending tabs. Already better content than Twitter, and without the racism too. I just wish it would show me more of the content from accounts I follow than random accounts I don't. Solid start though, will only improve from here as new features are added. 👌App is generic, took a long time to install. Requires Instagram, nothing but Instagram without pictures. Don't waste your time, just another app.Display rendering issue where text overlays on top of everything when scrolling or opening menu makes app completely unsustainable.My threads app working but when i scroll the first screen stays and the scrolled pard overlapping the pervious content its looks like a mess even i switch home to my profile its still overlapping.Actually, it's nothing to compare with twitter i don't have to go in details but they are definitely two different platforms. I prefer twitter though.Its an awesome app, simple and minimalistic (maybe too much) instagram needs to add some features like saving photos and translate languageI was very excited about the threads app but it is not starting It was showing glitche screen fro very first time I have downloaded it I am not able to use the app even for a single second Please fix this issue InstagramIt is a great site for keeping up with the latest news from top journalists. Also, it is not a cesspool of white supremacy and hate as opposed to the dying bird site.Once you get over the fact that your timeline is literally every brand in the universe and you have to mute all of them to see suggested posts that are closer to who you follow, it's... A Twitter app alright.First day: Enjoyed seeing things from people I follow and know. Second day: My feed was full of corporate garbage and posts from randoms. Inmediately uninstalled it. And no way to change it back.It scrolls so slowly. I think the developers probably forgot that not everyone uses a phone with high refresh rate. It doesn't scroll smoothly like Twitter.Honestly! It's a good app but it can't be compete with Twitter because it's has very limited and so much boring features and Twitter has much Fun but hopefully it will improve in future! But now time I gave it 1 star ⭐It's a good app but you need to make it independent not to link it up with instagram when signing in, and we need a lite version this is too heavy to some android phonesThreads has bug in it when I use every words and letter are reflected multiple times and crashes the app. I request @instagram to fix it . Note: My mobile is 4 GB Ram Redmi note 6 proI love the app, the experience is awesome. But there is no direct message yet, no way to save media or delete unwanted postSmooth, clean, just a little buggy at the moment re: posting pics. Keeps crashing.UI is great I wish you have this kind of UI on WhatsApp and fb too but excuse me can you please rather then making a different app put all threads features on Instagram somewhere. 2 different features in one app will be better.Can't seem to like posts when it reach certain amounts of cache, red color won't show up. Needs to \"clear cache\" to solve the problem.There's nothing of substance at all. My feed is not personalized. I followed all the people I follow on Instagram but instead of seeing their posts I just was forced to look at a ton of celebrities whose posts I do not care about and do not want. I am going to uninstall now because this was not an enjoyable experience.Could be promising, but it's already randomly closing out entirely. I feel like instead of developing a new app, Meta should just focus on making its current apps work like they should.Downloaded on day one and have througoly enjoyed this app since. People actually interact with each other and far right trolls don't even last a day. Oh, and I haven't seen a single ad!It has good design and all but the app itself has bug it always glitches so you can't even use it. But i hope they'll fix it.Looks stable on Android so far. Please add an option to disable \"Autoplay\" function for videos.Recently using it and there's an error in this app. I am reloading the screen for the nth times and the only thing it says is \"something went wrong\"Nice UI. But we can't save pics and I wish there is an option to only see the threads from the people we follow. Also no dark mode.There is unnecessary things on your feed and there is no option to view only following ones, everything becames about photos and photos, of this is another Instagram then why the f i use this over twitter, Twitter is still the best..Bugs.... Everytime I open the home page... It keeps blurry and showing some duplicating effect of texts.... Still needs more improvementsNo problem with the app so far, but my timeline looks awful. It's full of cringeworthy posts from blue checkmark accounts that no one asked for. Algorithm cringe level is 999Discovery is difficult, any post of advertising creator merch on there will be hidden from discovery instantly without notice, so smaller creators who use this platform will end up having issues, i did it as a one time experiment using my creator account @pandaherocommunity and it was hidden publicly on the threads browser, currently only my public personal account is getting discovery benefits, but post engagement is close to zero.Works well enough. It would benefit by creating a separate feed for the people I follow and another for the trending topics. Just my 2 cents.It's a great app but It would be better if I could switch accounts like Instagram. And I can't see how many people I follow. I would be grateful if these two things could be updated.Second day with app and there's a bug. The app won't open and says I've changed the password. I have not. Disappointed.An edit function would be nice. Also, there is a bug wherein you cannot preview if a post is liked on the main news feedThe videos stop playing once I unmute the sound. I'm not sure why but other than that, it's a cool app I guess.The layout is so bad. It looks awful and feels too minimalistic, like there was no care put into how it looksA buggy mess right now. Photos fail to upload without any rhyme or reason. App's got potential but shouldn't just be another Twitter ripoff.Crashes alot and as a Twitter dupe!/alternative so many features are missing like lista, seeing your followers and following quickly, crashes, just a lot to be asked ofRuns well and is easier to use than twitter while not as much content as older social media (this is to be expected for a young app) it is easy to use and set up shows great promiseWhy when I use it , it's glitching . I did screenshot it. Does my device not compatible. It can't be, cause I'm able too download & play games like genshin impact, etc .My dear @threadsapp, A complaint: We can save any image from Twitter to our gallery, but I don't get that feature here on this platform. Hope you solve this problem soon.UI/UX of this application sucks, like there is no option to create a new account from threads app, imagine if someone had to create an instagram account in order to create threads app. Chat function must be added if you guys want active users, cuz if user can chat here the might spend more time than just scrolling the feed so i threads will only attract the users which they already have so threads might not be long lasting....Totally in love with the app. It's been only few hours using it. I'll let you guys know if there are any drawbacks as well. This is similar to Twitter app, but in more fun way 😄This is the best app I had ever used. Its logo is very attractive. Its has autocorrect feature also that is very helpful. So guy's What's the delay Download threads now and follow my threads account : parkour_community_1It was great until for some reason I get \"something went wrong\" message. I CAN'T post, comment, or even look at my own profile. Reached out and no help.A good app. I like that you can actually view threads from different people without a chronological order. The randomness of this app is awesomeA very powerful platform already... But every time I try to upload an image the app closes. This bug is irritating.It ain't working for me. It's glitching. Bro fix it. I want to use the app. I have installed and uninstalled it like 2 times.It is a very good app but there is a small problem, if we delete it when we don't need it, our Instagram account will also be deleted. Other than that, it's a better app than TwitterYou should give a chat section as well so if someone wants to talk then he can. And if you say that we can chat on Instagram, that is a different thing but I strongly advise to add a chat section.The app is not working properly There's a glitch in it Whenever I open the app everything on the interface just starts to vibrate..... Can't even read it properly Help it outIt's buggy, full of bugs and posting failed continuously, also app crashes on my high end processor phone.Exactly what I was looking for when I left Twitter! Comments and replies should display your own at the top though, so you know your post went thru or if you want to fix an autocorrect errorAdd a dislike button to the all and it's 5 stars, it's more interactive that way, and some hilarious moments will come from it, the app will blow up with this simple changeWhat is this app, it does not working at all....the app is too laggy sorry I don't know what it is I should called but the worst app ever....please fixed the bug...... I wish I could saw you some photo or some thing...but that not possible.... THANK YOUNot visible, when opens app after the first screen there are blurry vision. And no support from them.Needs a couple more features, such as bookmarks, being able to see quotes, etc. But overall a good substitute for twitterThe feed is completely useless. As for content the non humourous meme pages are all over. If they are not then some random person posting her pic making it Instagram 2.0.Works alright, has some flaws. Similar to the bird app run by the insane guy. Really needs a dark mode, the white screen is giving me a headache.Would love it if I can see the posts I've liked. Also a download option, as well as visible buttons for videos (play, mute, etc.).I'm the first review! This seems phenomenal! Look i only have one problem. I'm an influencer and when I logged in with insta I had 0 followers on threads while all of them on Instagram. You should have an option to keep the following same as it takes months to build it again and is very frustrating. EDIT : Get hashtags back!!Recently began crashing when I'd select a re-thread(?) post to check that person. And then when I'd relaunch the app, it began showing me accounts I don't even followGreat so far, but its missing the option to be able to search for tags & keywords, and also a following page. Id like to be able to see posts for those who im following in one place, please add thisAlright, 83rd review for the Threads on Google play. The app is alright, first flight is nice and shine. Everything is smooth. Hashtags don't seem to serve it's purpose though.I liked the app but still need traslation ,story,and messaging maybe would make it more enjoyable....but most importantly the privacy matters and changing name and username should be different in both insta and threads please🥹This is great app where everyone can explore more and more information and their thoughts 😀 😊. I just want to give thanks to Mark Zuckerberg and his tech team who make this fantastic app for all of us. I'm happy with this thread app. Thank you...I just downloaded because im usually the last one to the party! Not sure I see the benefit of Threads, so im giving it a 3/5 so far as was able to import my Insta profile with no faults...Your policy meant nothing. I cant uninstall this app as my account is interlinked and \"will delete my account if uninstalled\". Dear Meta, please change your policy. If not, its your loss that this app has 3.0 ratings...Nothing new: tweeter of Meta But it doesn't work well with Gboard and you have to write blindly, without know what exactly you are writing. Nada nuevo, un Twitter de Meta. Pero no funciona bien con Gboard y el teclado cubre que estás escribiendo, así escribes a la ciegaViable Twitter alternative. However, continually shows threads of people I don't follow. There are no settings to change this. This makes it essentially unusable 🤷‍♂️The app is new and exciting. I have few suggestions though. First, it would be ideal for users to be able to join without having an IG account, not all of us have or prefer using IG. Good start Meta.This has lot of potential ,in 6 months to one year time this could be a Twitter 🐦 killer !? This app is very easy to use n set up when you have an Instagram account ! 5 🌟 for now 👀Great app. Scrolling needs to be fine tuned. It seems to scroll slower than other apps relative to how fast I'm swiping.Good work by insta team . But problem is that I can't be able to retrieve/add my threads ID after I remove it from instagram profile. Please work on it . Thank you 😊The app has really well UI consistently fluent with Instagram, but it can't ever develop into microblogging site like Twitter.Instagram info migration is good. However only follower feed option on home is a MUST feature. Wont use the app if that isn't implemented.I love the clean interface and the lack of pointless config however why is my feed filled with people I don't follow??? I've tried the suggested work arounds and they don't workGood features, but downloading pictures and videos is not allowed there. No option of share link of post.The app is Horrible, each time I wanted to post or even text something, that app keeps closed. I am very disappointed of Meta for copying Twitter. Twitter is better.Platform is good but confused, is there was a need of it? It is a combination of Insta and Twitter we can say like it. Let see further Threads will be a game changer or not. My personal opinion is there was not need of it.It would be better if I could only see threads from people I follow, instead of the whole world. How is this any different from twitter? And would also be better if it was just within the Instagram app itself.Just used one day of it and the next day always prompt I've been logged out and the owner might change password. Well, it's connected with my IG and never changed password though.Needs more development, but most definitely a good alternative for Twitter and great for anyone who likes keeping up with real verified people, not bots. Anyone giving lower than a 4 star it just butt hurt Elon fangirl.Theres still more that needs to be done, I love the idea of a meta intagrated social spsce but the UI still lacks that flare and i need to be able to control my feed in the near futureUser friendly and great experience... It'll do well in the long run. More features needs to be added thou.Why must I sign up first for instagram before being able to use this app? I never liked or used instagram and so cannot be forced to, which is why I am uninstalling until the developer/s can think right and make it independent.Don't know how to say about this application. Similar to \"The Blue Bird\"🤣🤣🤣🤣 but the difference that I found is No direct message and No Hashtag. No direct message is more new approach like whatever you do you says, goes public (but for private accounts goes to your friends and followers) BUT no Hashtag to search the topic we need. That's make me don't know of how to use this application anymore. (Keep it don't delete it people say it could affect Instagram's account. 🤣🤣🤣It was working perfectly but all of a sudden it's like glitching I don't know what is the matter, anyone who has an idea on how to fix it just assist me coz this app is supper great I have expirienced itThe app doesn't work for me, the screen flashes and has errors, my phone is the Redmi Note 6 Pro, it's an old phone but it should be compatible :c3 stars because it needs work. After joining and following all my friends on Facebook, when I open the app, I am getting only threads by strangers! Is there a setting to only see threads from people I follow?Well it's great BUT I don't like the way that I can't change the name in my thread like it should be connected with my ig, beacuse i don't want to have the same username in ig and in thread so i might uninstall this app laterFix your bug. While scrolling down the post overlap each other and all words jumbled at the same time and collapsed post visible on screen.The threads app in my phone is very glitchy the letters and posts gets overlap on one another and when I switch windows in between it's also gets overlaped on each other.So many crashes! On xiaomi ! From this morning! I can't even use the app! And beside all that! If it's trying to take Twitter's place ! Where the heck is explore?? Seriously?At this point in time, unless there is a Tweetdeck like option to filter content, it is a colossal waste of time to cull through the unwanted nonsense.Despite the fact that the app is still developing, I don't see the reason why it keeps scrambling up when I try scrolling through the threads. This needs attention pls.Its got a lot of potential. Creating a post is still a bit basic cuz i can only attach from my gallery. I cant use my camera for impromtu things.Why when you comment more than 2 lines, you can't see the second line and now you're typing blind? My keypad blocks the text box. This is annoying.The feed is nothing but suggested people and threads with maybe 1% of who you actually follow (much like Facebook but without an option for following only). Take a note from Twitter and make a Timeline where you get what you want or this app will failThe app overall is pretty good! Though it crashes when I try to post a thread with a picture.App looks good but it's unfinished.I can't download pics no # . Like button should be on right or at least can change left or right . Meta just rush it out cuz they wanna be the first to rival with Twitter.Still need a lot to do and I don't think this will beat Twitter cuz main reason people use Twitter is because nsfw content.Thread should at least allow nsfw content and give user whether they wanna hide it or not.Its not that difficult,other social media app have it.After removing or hiding the Threads badge from Instagram profile it can't be replace or unhide. It's a bad issue in this application. So update features to replace or unhide the Threads badge to instagram account.Having a lot of problems when I move the feed up or down it freezes straight away and doesn't seem to move. Please solve this problem.My app has been hanging, the text and images aren't clear, please do something about it. I really need to start accessing the appComplicated interface, not interested in this app, very booring, there should be improvement in user interface, it's far worse than Twitter or InstagramThe app is overall good. But we can't make two accounts. Means on insta we can login two accounts. But on threads, I can't login another account.It's glitchy on my phone. Like everytime I scroll, the text or pic become shadowy or shaded. Please, optimize it. My device: Mi Mix 2The cool thing about @threadsapp for me is the ability to have actual conversations and build communities and friendships through sharing thoughts instead of sharing content. I like talking. I like listening. I like threads.Its a good up funny to be honest and generally social but kindly it has a small problem.... Has a glitch as you scroll down.... With that fixed all will be good........... I can't use it because of the glitchSo far so good buuut I keep getting kicked out, and I use a Chromebook, not a phone so how do I make screen bigger? I know its a work in progress, so I'll be patient.Look very similar to Twitter... But quite interesting one of the best feature is it is connected to Instagram.. so we cane follow the same people's..... Definitely it can beat the TwitterSuper but... I like it as social network but to move from Twitter needs some tweeks. 1- should have option to see whom I follow only. 2- l wish to have option to see Instagram followers and out side Instagram community. I'm looking forward to reach stage get rid of Twitter under Musk. I hope this will be soon.This may become my go-to social media app. They just need to add an edit feature. But it's definitely a kindler and gentler world than Twitter.Needed to move away from Twitter so bad. Threads is great and is scaling really well so far. Clean interface and fun to use! Bye bye Elon' dumpster fire called Twitter!Has potential but pretty bare bones atm. The lack of hashtags and the inability to search Threads makes discoverablity nonexistent. Bookmarks and media tab would also be good.I'm really loving threads so far. My only suggestions would be to provide having multiple accounts logged in like Instagram does, and some UI customization like themes and colors, maybe headers for our accounts.Recently I installed the spp on my phone but it keeps on flickering and unable to read anything...please help me to fix it....I don't feel giving one star but my situation nakes me to do it..Definitely I'll give 5star if you guys help me to fix my issue.my android version us lollipop.Great app. Downside : I want curate my home be to be able to only see the content of the people follow my friends. As opposed to what's trending from a bunch of people I don't know.This app is fantastic! The user interface is sleek and intuitive, making it a breeze to navigate. The features are well-designed and incredibly useful. Thank you for creating such a great app!\"There's still a lot to fix in this app. The unnecessary restrictions are just too much and it's making the app look a lot like a child's play...Sure, there will be some issues with a new app. Including features that others are demanding. Give the team some time please! Threads is already superior than other similar platforms.This app is not working well on my phone. It's repeating the writing on the screen, the app look exactly like twitter though.Wait... There is only one way in... No sign up, no signin with phone number or... Just login with Instagram😞. Now you've to create Instagram account that is data consuming.. I'm sure this app will consume data as wellThe app is crashing as soon as I get to the main feed. Going directly to posts etc via notifications doesn't do that.I very like it, more ez to use than twitter, ui simple and enjoyable. But of course things can be improve. I hope you can add hashtag,gif, and i hope also yall can seperated of our friend thread and global. Overall goodjob ✨💪OMG, User interface is mind blowing and user experience is lagging, like its little bit confusing. #threads will roar the market. As a UI Ux Designer the first impression was 💜💥.Everything is fair but we even can't change our threads username. It's same as the instagram. It uses all the instagram information that i don't like so. But 2 star for this app will be fine. I think so...The feed is littered with people I don't know or care about. If my feed consisted of people I follow it would be pretty good. Spend most of my time on there muting/blocking peopleI'm rating 4 stars. The app itself is not so good for use but it has built a large community. May be in future they introduce all the other features. Right now there are so few things to do here. But I hope it will become better than other platforms.Comparing this app with other apps developed by meta this app needs more time to reload the page which makes me feel uncomfortable I checked my internet and phone but still sometimes it take time to reload The main page.People don't understand that this app is just launched recently so it will take some time to get more features. It'll become very popular medium of expressing own thoughts in the futureMy problem with this app is that it doesn't translate what others are saying. I stan GOT7 💚 but 4 of the members are Koreans, I don't understand korean, I need this app to translate.Can only log in via Instagram and then when trying to create Instagram account no verification emails or SMSs are sent. Keep it, I'll stick to Twitter, Elon and all.The app is very big crash, full of bugs, but it's good to see Instagram is trying something new fantastic keep it upOk in its beginning stages but - FYI crashes everytime I switch accounts. Have to uninstall then reinstall like 20 times already in order to check on both accounts.Hmmm, my device got a bug. So apparently my screen only stack each activity so it will be unuseable even for scrolling. My device is Sony Xperia XZ1 SOV36. If your team can fix it I will be gladly rate it 5 starsI get that you want to promote or show messages from other users, but please, for the love of all that is good, give me the option to turn that off. I only want to see messages from the people I follow, not everyone else on the platformThe app needs some updates such as languages alignment. When I write a sentence in Arabic and then I want to write something in English it doesn't fit and everything stars to be messyPretty cool app. It's quite seems like Twitter, but it's still quite interesting to use and explore. Hopefully, this application will be famous as same as Facebook with over 5B downloaders.Threads app needs a lot of work, but as a basic experience it actually functions well, much more than can be said of Twotter nowadays.For a while I give one star, because this application does not have a system to restore hidden thread badges on the Instagram profile. If there was, I would give 5 stars.Overall a nice application, feels like something fresh in the market but this definitely needs some brand new things that would make it unique compared to other platforms 🐒It's cool so far, just lacking some basic functions like trending topics and bookmarking posts. I hope some of these will be added in the future.Just another Twitter but getting unnecessary contents from pages I don't follow. It's really annoying to scroll through and find the threads from the people that I follow.Loving it. Feed seems so out if place though. There are so many random posts. Would love to get an option for choosing global and followers tweets.This app is really amazing. A very good alternative for Twitter. Please add a translate option. It'd be really helpful...Waste of time if you don't have Instagram. Again if you don't have one you can't get other. This app removes my freedom of choice. Super unhappy.I'm sad abt this... Coz... I installed three times but when I open it I'm not getting app properly... Some tym of glitch is occured. I need it to be work good.. Hope u will take action on itHonestly, this app is so far a solidly good app, but I wish you guys could let me and the rest of us on here to change our profile without importing Instagram profile pictures.No DM, No search function, No hashtag support, No ability to only see people I follow in my feed and it's just an endless torrent of random verified accounts you've never heard of. This is the brain dead cousin of Twitter; not its replacement. Even with the 600 tweet cap, Twitter has significantly more functionality and purpose.Downloaded the app but there was no place to sign up or seeing where to login through Instagram but still that doesn't even work. Meta is way bigger than something as poor as this.Okay Markus and the Threads crew, listen up. I NEVER write reviews, so you know I liked this app. I don't wanna have to come back and lower it, so hear me out: KEEP IT SIMPLE. From what I can tell, the main draw for a lot of people is the simplistic interface, and how clean and refreshing it feels to not be bogged down by engagement. PLEASE KEEP THAT. Obviously Threads isn't in its final form, but something about it is special 😭 Please be careful. Thassit, be easy, y'all ✌🏽The new app is totally different and so awesome! But something is going on with the app now, I can't refresh my account or comment nor post why ? Hope my account isn't having any issues yet ? Or is it from threads app ?As I tap on speaker option to enable audio, video just gets paused automatically and then I'm unable to unpause it until I turn off the audio :/First version is still basic, less functionality, I like the design, and I hope the app followed changing to be better.The worst app by meta. It behaves like a bug and the pages are overlapping each other. No matter what I try it's the same... Hate itThis is Twitter's competition app and it is also good, simplification is also there, but there is still a lot of shortage in it; Like trends, @, # and no option to save photoA good app so far. The people are nice and caring unlike that bird app. It needs some things yet, but I'm sure they will get there. I'm happy with it so far. ☮️🖖I like the app. It has beautiful UI/UX designs. It's smooth and most importantly it's simple.This app is cool but there is something missing in my opinion. 1 post pin, 2 photo editing, 3 post editing and the last one hashtags.. What you guys thinkingPlease the app so far is Good. I'm having a challenge since yesterday whenever I try to upload a photo as a thread,the app shuts down. Please try and fix it.It's been very smooth. I really love this app..... We need the tending topics and Spaces functionality added to it. Thank you.It should be our choice that if we want to show our replies to friends or keep them fully private to ourself. Or if there will be an option on every reply that some of them we want to show our friends and some fully private to us... In our profile section.There needs to be a way to turn off auto playing video, and there needs to be a chronological feed with only posts and shares from people I follow.Not sure why this is but I'm having issues opening the app now, getting an error \"invalid parameters\" and I have no idea why, can someone help?Do NOT install! The app is following accounts automatically on behalf of my account or sending follow request without me knowing. I don't even open the up, just receiving the notifications. Isn't that illegal Zuck??This is basically Twitter with Instagram theme. The set up was too smooth. Edit: I will suggest that trending topics should be visible when users click on the search sectionNot sure how i feel. It's a great concept, but it's also made by the same corporation that doesn't seem to be able to give basic customer support to users of facebook and instagram.The UI is very broken, I can't even scroll without stuff completely breaking. Can't even describe.Meh. I never wanted my \"twitter\" life and Instagram to be the same place. Plus I can't delete my account without deleting my Instagram so that's pretty manipulative. Twitter is still somehow better, which is saying a lot.Actually this app doesn't work properly. As soon as I opened this app, there will be overlapping of everything I see la. I don't think it will work la 🥴its good but like missing important features please for the love of god add the ability to sort my feed by following and let me get 2 accounts at once wth this is like basic this should've been there from the startI can't see the settings icon on the profile , page top right corner, somehow it works when i click the empty space besides the Instagram icon😅, fix that and bring Deep dark mode theme ASAPApp is good all perfect but i really appreciate if you guys.. threads team add a group chat,private message,profile banner,content selection and voiceI feel really old, but I remember this app from back in the day called Twitter—it feels incredible, how far we have come as a species.Amazing app. Thanks to Zuck and his company. It's a wonderful app with a wonderful beginning. But there's a lot to integrate and configure in the app.Has stopped working for the last hour but, phenomenal work. This will bring life to the Instagram society with variety of attachments included in a single thread. Please keep it away from bots.Can't get logged in. I use Instagram, but don't have a log in option for it. I log in using my Facebook account. No option for that in this app.More than any other app it has the potential to topple Twitter, but it needs features! We need a way to organize our follows.I love the app but there are two major problems, it glitches and the writing overlaps itself, you also can not see the comment you're making, if these are fixed it'll be 10x better then TwitterTerrible. No engagement. Not even worth signing up. Make sure to uninstall it and don't leave their spyware hanging around on your phone.i give 1 star. this app is good but dont give the option to just see the Threads only from the people we follow ! why must i read from strangers ?? enough with the random strangers rant in our feed ! and there's no translation service. good thing is it filters out p0rn unlike shwitter.The app is pretty simple and easy to interact with. I observe there is no way to save a thread or at least bookmark it for future reference.Its good and wasy to use. The design is simple and understandable unlike other apps that just have all the things jumbled up. I like it.Pls consider to separate it from insta honestly. Like it's quite unsafe to be logged with only one acc and one password, if one go down, another will too.There is no option to join without using instagram. I'm trying to limit my exposure to social media and not spend my days browsing social internet like these vultures would like you to. This was only an expression of interest, I will move on.For giving support to someone I know I installed this app \"Threads \" but when I come to know that If we delet this account same way my Instagram account which i have will also get deleted it's just against our freedom to use the app and the control was commanded by META.. not just me but many like me was wishing to delet this app without loosing data form Instagram...Good job, really an alternative to twitter . Now there's a need to provide option so text can be increased for people like me who found the text to be tiny Thumps up3 stars for now. It's a good app and I see plenty of potential but I wish there was a tab or page where I can see the posts of people I only follow and not random people that I don't followForced close on launch. Had been great.. added 200 of the 300 twitter people I follow (mostly just EU accounts missing now). But desperately needs a keyword search to find anything other than what the people I follow said.Its pretty decent, however I'm having problems with my notifications. I get the notifications VERY late, sometimes DAYS later.The feed is full by posts of complete strangers and ads. I came there to see what my friends are up to, not random people.At first I had a waiting list for confirmation of follow requests.. I started to confirm one by one, but when I refreshed that list is hide. Where I can return back or found it again?so far so good here, very minimalist and not to overwhelming app with bunch of numbers at the bottom of a post.The app is mad glitchy, like I just logged in first time and everything is glitching worst than the matrix, I don't what happened or is the app incomplete or what but I cannot even scroll!Good app,,, though some things must be fixed to have the best One. Pic must be easy to download as in Twitter, chat features and remove auto videos play its killing our billsLoving the app There's still some stuff needed like pinning posts. I keep getting shut out of the app, I don't know if this could be looked intoCan't search anything that i want to see just getting random posts of random blue tick people on my home page, give me what i want to see not what you want to show me. And every next post is about twitter vs threads looks like this app was not made for entertainment it was made to war with twitterJust updated the app , it keep saying i've been logged out of %1$s account owner may have changed the password , an account i just created days ago , you need to fix this!!Needs improvement, but I'm on board... Improvements in: pinning, hashtags, searching for threads, threads of followers vs. for-you, and the UI speed for some reason.A decent enough Twitter clone but cycling through irrelevant content just makes it feels exhausting. App needs a Followers tab or a better algorithm soon, or we're going to bail.More annoying to use then Twitter. Its just needlessly complicated and basic at the same time. Just stick to standard instergram.Really a great app. A great platform to engage with everyone. Also the reach and impression are adequate.Seriously, there's no way to limit my feed to only the accounts that I follow? Without that functionality, this app is nothing but a torrent of useless noise from celebrities and influencers, and I'm not interested.Not bad, but the switch between accounts not possible !!!!! And the videos somtimes with no audio. Using galaxy S21 UltraThe app's been working smoothly to me but I do hope more features will be added soon tho. Like you can also search for keywords or hashtags and read the requotes of a tweet.It's so buggy. All of my threads for the past 48 hours got deleted for I don't know why. When you try to post a photo, it goes to your IG feed - meanwhile they said that the app is for conversation.This app has been frustrating me since. I can't post or make a comment and my app keep logging out on its own. I just updated it and yet still same problem. Please you guys should do something about itThreads app offers a seamless and engaging social media experience, with it's user-friendly interface, real time updates and vibrant community, making it a must-have for connecting and sharing with others.Post notifications are delayed af, some posts get visualised as repries in the feed with that donut string, the ig symbol vanishes from all profiles, the sound symbol on videos just vanished! Why even release such an incomplete product?It is a very great app like it so smooth but one thing I don't like they asking for a lot of you data like your health and fitness ..... this one other then that great app room for improvementLogged out to log into a different account and now I can't get in at all and the app crashes every time I open it to attempt to login.Amazing conversations, amazing people and amazing Experiences... This is what we build at Meta Threads The conversation Opener... Probably the perfect ad copywriting( lol) Best app.I don't know about bugs but app sucks a lot keep stopping while writing something and getting back with a message not responding! Oh problem startOh boy, let me tell you about Threads app - it's like Twitter and Instagram had a baby, but with a hilarious sense of humor! I've never laughed so much while scrolling through a social media app before.Horrendous. Crashes. Can't choose albums when uploading. An app about threads but can only post 4 images per thread .4 stars for the whole application but can you put a button for save pictures it's hard to save a picture from the app. Thank you.When I installed this app it doesn't work properly and work like it's hanged my screen doesn't work properly in this app, and I was trying to work properly automatically from 2 days but it doesn't .the app was good and kinda quiet interesting than fb, but there's no edit option if you want to change something on your captionsI was sent a \"Your account has been suspended.\" message from instagram a day after using this app (without any posts to Threads *or* Instragram, note.) The \"appeal suspension\" process requires a few obnoxious recaptchas, then writing your real name and taking a selfie, so this may just be more datamining from Meta, but it's insanely obnoxious either way.I like the basic fitur such add much image and the slide layout really versatile, love it this far. Looking forward for updates featuresSo far so good. But I think it'll be best if followers and followings on instagram are automatically sent to threads since they're both found in one space.A complete mess on screen as it's not refreshing correctly on my Android phone (v9), so until that's fixed, it's unusableOh I am the first one to review on this...so I would like to thanks everyone including thread and Instagram team and my friends and well-wishers and also those who are not well wisher..without your support or guidance ..my first review would have not been possible..thanks a lot . :)Nice app but need to include features like :- 1. Poll option 2. Image cropping before posting 3. Data saver mode like Video Autoplay off 4. Media section seperately on Profile page.Threads seems good so far. Please consider adding separate a tab in user profiles to view their media content only. Also add a way for us to view posts that we've liked.First and foremost, the fact that I cannot delete my account is completely unacceptable. As a user, I should have the right to control my online presence and decide whether I want to continue using the app or not. However, this app has taken away that freedom, leaving me feeling trapped and powerless.The app Glitches. Texts Images everything, overlaps on itself, gets on top of each other. And I can't see anything, nor usethe appat first it's okay to make friends or to follow individuals in this platform but you'll get restricted if you interact more, like please let us interact more to each other without getting restricted or blockedMissing features like trending topics, search by keyword, filtering results by location, etc.I think there is something wrong with the app because when I try to enter my password in the account sense I forget it automatically it stopped, why is that and even in Instagram when I tried to change it it stopped too 🤷🤷🤷 what's wrong ⁉️Great start, i think thread will overtake twitter very quickly, of course since elon musk bought twitter, most of all it has come with a lot of restrictions which the user base doesn't like anymore but There are still some trust issues in the thread because this application also asks to access your complete data. And major part ~ YOU CAN'T DELETE YOUR THREADS ACCOUNT WITHOUT DELETING YOUR INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTI dislike that sharing a post is called \"repost\". As an artist, reposting a post usually consists of someone saving art and posting it to their own account. Sharing or \"retweeting\" is welcome, but reposting is a no-no. Why would this app call sharing \"reposting\"?? It's unclear who gets the \"like\" when a post is shared. It should be the op. That is one thing IG does not get right (and Twitter does). I hope Meta gets it right. Option to delete threads account without deleting IG.More like Instagram than Twitter. Too much media. You can't even disable videos being played automatically! That's a big issue for me!Seems pretty decent. UI Translations need bit polish. The Top action bar looks empty. Dark mode is great.Open app, mute 3 to 4 profiles I don't follow that are showing up in my timeline, close app. Not great so far.For god's sake fix the app. I literally can't read anything and the app is getting hang up and the screen is not visible. PleaseWhy is the treads account linked to your Instagram account? It's so annoying. This should be the user's choice if they want an account on threads or not. Meta really needs to change this.But please add on translation features so the conversation throughout the diversity of language can be transparent with each other in this community. Hope you take this as consideration.It's ok but cannot download videos or images like I can on Instagram or twitter and Facebook, maybe some one will get around to writing on or just use the Instagram's downloader.Guys, honestly I'm saying don't install this app, read all his data collection detail.. your data will be collected including your voice recording or even your payment info.. 🙏 uninstall this..Almost identical to but even worse than Instagram if that's possible. Still can't comment pics. Who developes a social media app without pictures? A fkn lizard! That's who!Their no problem in use but need one and important thing...thatz automatic translations....where is it??????????As a k pop lover...I need to connect with my idols post which is in Korean language...I don't know Korean....what to do?????? If I have to abandon this app I also forced to uninstall Instagram toooo....why Mr mark Zuckerberg ???? I need custom made items in this app... messenger???Once I open the app shows overlapped content consistently Giving us a dizziness and irritation. 2. Unable to download the media like photos making it very difficult to use this if we want the media.Trust me when I say this app is crazily amazing, I like the fact that it is connected to your Instagram account, and it is quite easy to navigateWould be a lot better if there was a chronological order and a what's trending in the world so if an event happens users will be able to see it in real time.At first it is okay . But now I can't seem to post anything on threads also I cant see any of my previous post on threads it keeps saying try again later. I tried to uninstall the app and re installed again but it is still the same. Please do fix this bug issue. I already report on threads.Cannot use Hastag on Post. Video post Automatically play,No pause Button. Data Saver Option Not Available in this app. Please keep update and fix itGreat app. Great potential. Great additions would be a following only feed & a DM system that's integrated with messenger & instagram DMs. A better followers & following system is also needed.it literally does not work, every time I try to do anything, even just scroll down, all the text and buttons overlap on each otherI really hope Threads make a traslate button bottom of the each thread text like twitter, if like that many non english user like me will use this app 100 times more, I hope read english thread more without copy and paste the text to translate appIt's a really great application. I totally enjoyed using it. Please release a Thread Lite version so people with less storage can also use it... Good luck Teamfew features we'd love to have: - ability to save media - translation - ability to bookmark / save threads & compartmentalise them - ability to manage following - repost numbers - thread viewsIt's a good start. But it needs a lot of new features. Especially a timeline for posts only from accounts you follow.I mean it a good platform but it's has some loops holes like you can't delete the app and once you unhide badge from profile it's never gonna come back jerks!!!!🏇 I other words it's just Elonmusk vs markzukerberg ..... So yeah enough the triffle but keep its little safe and private to perform these activites on such platformStill has a long ways to go. Please don't show me suggested Influencers or Pages I don't follow. I don't want to see half my feed of posts I have no desire or care for just to help increase their platform. Show me only what I specifically follow. Also, you should consider adding a Trending page and not JUST a search function page.Greate app with good features and also fast but want I don't like about the app is that when you want to comment on a post the comment box will be under the keyboard and will will restrict you from seeing what you are typing. Hope it will be resolvedI am disappointed for your threads app your app is after the download then I enter your app the app flickering and a page is like disconnected cable connection problem🤣🥴. So to solve the problemHome page is some nightmare algorithm, like Twitter's \"For you\". I simply want to only see posts from people I follow. A \"lists\" feature would be nice too.Smooth and easy. Everything is clear for to understand, and the upgrades are lit. 👍So far it's what it should be. A new \"Twitter\" like app by Meta for meta users. It's a little rough around the edges obviously, it hasn't even been 24 hours. It's fun and easy to use, no rate limits!This is a nice start but there's some basics that need to be added. I can't see a list of who I'm following, and I want the option to see posts from people I follow and posts I'll be interested in. Not posts I don't care to see.App is facing some issues. It's not working properly and glitches are showing in the feed.Not what I expected.. with that being said I was informed if I delete the app my Instagram gets deleted as well. Why would you do that.. not a fan of it, it's complicated if you ask me. DisappointingApp is good when it works. Recently, all my posts have been getting an error message saying \"failed to upload\"Very simple easy to use and amazing applicationI'm looking forward to the live streaming and audio chat functionality between friendsGreat so far, needs a following feed and also fix video playback and having no sound on Android.I think i Love this apps its amazing. I believed and got confidence that threads app have now kicked off Twitter, i was frustrated by Twitter millions times. Keep it up, Threads to the WorldThe app is good because I can share what's on my mind, but the problem is there's no followback button. You need to visit the profile first so you can follow it backExcited for this one. Ofc being 1st day means some glitches here and there, like the like animation isn't all that intuitive.Sometimes I think to myself, what does this world really need? Like, REALLY need? And the only answer I could think of was a website where you can write short pieces of text and have people from all around the world like and comment on said text. Then BOOM, zucker creates this. Mind blown.Havent even used it yet as it's unusable. My app is glitiching too much that I am not able to see it's features. please fix this problemGood social network. App is OK, but needs features like displaying latest threads chronologically and only from accounts you follow.It was very good!!!! You should add the feature by which we can download post and videos from someone's thread.No chronological timeline, no way to show posts from only people you follow, no way to organize lists of topics. A heavily watered down and censored version of TwitterIt's a really nice one, at least for a start. I just wish there's a better way to search for photos to post, not me going through everything in my galleryChaotic timeline, no chronological order and mostly posts from ppl u dont follow. No options to save data or stop videos auto play. Back to twitter hopefully till ur app updates satisfy twitter users' tasteOverall it looks good, It would be even better if it could show the trending topics like it shows on Twitter, it makes it more interestingNeed fix for my phone. When i scroll the entire screen just look shredded and unreadable so it's unusable for me atm. I'm waiting for this issue to be fixed. Ty... .A copied version of Twitter. It's glitching so much and boring. Just it's new & by Instagram that's why people came to see. Otherwise nothing new and good. Boring App.It'll be very great thing to make that app different from other apps by deleting every stupid thing and closing toxic people accounts you found in other apps . MAKE IT DIFFERENT BY MAKING IT SAFE PLACE FOR EVERYONE.Will only show me posts from brand accounts and celebrities, with no way to either tailor the stream, or see a 'following only' style stream. Totally useless for staying up to date with the accounts you care about. Disappointing.It keeps on flickering. Images and text are garbled. Unusable at the moment.Love at first sight! Just have a small suggestion: Can you add a feature to save Threads just like saving posts on IG. I think like I'm missing a lot while scrolling.1. can't see my following list right now, keeps on glitching 2. add a feature indicates whether a user follows me in my following list 3. able to edit posts 4. able to archive a post 5. able to change name and username without instagramIt's just a clone app of Twitter. But i like it more than twitter.. please don't allow users to upload adult contents as like twitter do. Lovely app, thanks to team meta for giving us a good platform to express our feelings through words. 😊I'm getting notifications from 2 days ago, not most recent. I would like to be able to sort my feed to only people I follow.It can be better. Need gifs so bad, wanna see reposts/quotes of someone's post by other people I don't follow. A few glitches here and there, but cool so far.The icing on the cake is how seamlessly Threads integrates with other Meta-owned platforms like Facebook and Instagram. I can easily share content across these platforms without any hassle.The app screen glitches every time I scroll, like it glitches so hard that the text becomes unreadable. Does anyone else experience this too? Or is it just me?It's not owned by a wannabe politician, but it's embarrassingly basic for a Facebook product. Needs hashtags or just a search feature, and a Trending list.This app seems smooth. It is, clearly, supposed to be like twitter, but i count it as a positive that now I can have twitter and instagram together in the same place. First.it's a really good app,i sometimes don't receive any notifications on it unless i open it then notifications come in but it's good nothing to complain about so far.Not terrible so far, I wish that I could filter content to only see the people I follow though. But for day one not a terrible app, just needs some time to improveThe app was good at first and I really love but the only problem I have is I cannot post picture anymore, when I truly to post it automatically closes, but if you fix that I will give it a 5starGood start! For this app to be truly 5 star we need: hashtags, following feed, chronological feed, GIF support, desktop client, multiple account support/Meta business Suite, ability to show your set name AND username... And for fun: custom app icon and material you icon/app support.I logged out to try and make an alt account but now it won't let me back in at all and it's keeps crashing. Also I'd liked my following feed to take priority over randos please and thanksCan't even use this app, everything is shaking and copies of same text, icons on each other. Please optimise this app for Android.So far, it's a positive experience and no opening day glitches. Feels like a slumber party with all the fun and Intentional kindness.No lists - the key Twitter feature. Also: you can't choose a username, it is the same as in Instagram.useless app no hashtags feature,no freedom of speech because you can also block any account, no direct message, big pictures like it is Instagram not microblogging app.I'll give it a 4 rating Good features Unique interms of censorship.. Suggestions 1. Let people that Follow you be visible Alone. 2. Need to also give opportunity to edit name without changing it from instagram.It's new, give it a chance! This is everything Twitter isn't and I'm so good with that! They are still making tweeks to the system but the best part is, there are no fascists!!This app seems pretty good so far, but I have noticed that any post notifications have been a day late in being delivered!Nothing new for obviously reasons. It's missed a big feature from the other: anonymity. People liked the other cause they could be someone else, a fun username and share random thoughts, far from real life people, so... Some people said that if your ig is on dark mode, than threads will also be. My ig is on dark mode and yet threads is on light. Would be better if this setting was a part, just add dark mode button on threads.Also you can't delete the account unless you delete your ig account.I'd really love to be able to save posts. It's a great feature from Twitter and I think Threads should have it.Tangles would be similar to hashtags on Instagram, but they would be specific to Thread. Tangles would allow users to easily find and follow conversations on topics that interest them.New app, hope to be a good app with no privacy issue and i request instagram to not add reel feature here please 🙏🏻🙏🏻, we are tired of reels , i request developers to make it geneune and no ui or icon changes everymonth , im giving 5 star to be a good app for all our gen and also request to add things in policy with those who put semi nude graphy should be banned ,we want a app who give our mind relax not stress.Sometimes i cannot post media and app crashes for some reason. But content and people are so wholesome.Great as far as texting but the app crashes or closes whenever I try to post photos or videos. What gives??So far, it's kind of a mess because you can't view only those you follow. Twitter still has that, so far ... I may not stick with this app if they don't let me curate my own feed.Will be a great addition with the associated linking to Instagram and Facebook. Great job Mark! Keep the business decisions based on business and needs. Not political like some other misguided guy!Its a good app. I have accidentally unhided the \"thread badge\" from Instagram bio. Please bring an option to add it back. :(Application is crashing while uploading picture. Can't upload even a single picture of small size. What the hell????My experience is that I am the 1st user to rate this app . Another experience is that the app is a rivalry motivated product with a expectation to beat Twitter... Let's ride...I love the app so much .. my pictures no longer auto crop. Hopefully in the next update there will be an album .Very promising so far, interested to see where it goes. Will adjust my review later when I've really gotten some good use out of it.Basically an Instagram remake with Metas same lame rules that until they disappear will not be able to take on Twitter which is a much better app. Lol this app is lame posts the exact same content as on Instagram what is the pointStill no improvements. Can't check following list. Can't check accounts to see their posts always says something went wrong. If that's the answer to twitter then it's laughable...Ever since I started using this app, I can no longer access the instagram page connected to it. It keeps stopping and It's so annoyingIntuitive and easy to use. Easy sign in and seamless incorporation with Instagram.the application looks nice from the outside and from the inside, but there are some hiccups you have in it, such as it doesn't have personal conversations, Twitter and Instagram And I searched for a theme in black when I find until now that it has another theme other than the white color and this does not suit people's thinking most of the time Dear Mark, Verify my personal account on Threads for free and you will be very grateful because I do not have the Enough money verify it by myself ThanksId like to suggest to stick associating instagram in this app as much as possible for its uniqueness frome the bird app. I am looking forward for your new ways.it seems fine really! but it keeps on lagging and the posts are overlapping whenever i start to scroll yeah it's fine. -fix it pleaseIt's alright but the scroll behaviour pisses me off. Stop restricting the scroll speed, it makes the app so annoying to scroll down and makes me leave faster.Great design and awesome features but sometimes app isn't working prorperly and showing insta followers on threads and somehow disappearing threads posts. Need little bit fixing.Smooth user interface so far, looking forward to some improvements and new featuresShowing a lot of promise. Just needs some added functions like the ability to search for topics you are interested in.I just downloaded the app and connected my Instagram account but the app is lagging a lot , it's not working properly at all , not even able to use a single featureI'm happy with this app. I want to unhide badge of threads on instagram also there is not other option for bring it back so i request you work for it asap. I appreciate your work. Please understand my concern.To much data collection, sensorship, and ownership of images. Zuckerberg don't need anymore apps. His companies phony fact checks to control the narrative is unreal and the extreme censorship of speech. I'll stick with twitter thanks.Nice interface. Easy to use as of now. Waiting to see more improvements for app stability.Where are the notifications? The app doesn't have ability to notify you when an account publishes a new thread. Pretty good and fun app otherwiseJust downloaded this and whenever I try to scroll or click on any buttons app started to shutter and when I close the window it is fixed idk why it happens but its annoying and I can't use the app.This app is under development and this version is quit lite missing some important features but i hope they will bring it in upcoming updates. App is pretty cleanOnly log in thru Insta. Should have been other options too. Downloaded and then deleted as no other log in options available. What if people not having Insta, wanna onboard threads for a different experienceYo !! This is it But here's an issue : there's no \"following\" option like it has on Instagram which lets you see posts from the accounts you follow. In threads once you scroll and exit, you'll never find the same post from those accounts ever again until you visit their profile. Please make it like it is on InstagramIts not working properly some kind of glitch i suppose but the texts are overlapping i downloaded it multiple times still not working properly same problem plz tell me how to fix this if there is wayIt's A Cool Apps. But When Writing A Text In Reply Box. Can't See The Reply Box Space Of Typing. Only Can Type The Words. Please Check This Problem.A very good, simple and easy to use app. The only thing that I need ASAP is translation option. Please include it 🥺I like it, so far I haven't got any issues and is a user-friendly app. I didn't have to create a new account. Everything was ported from Instagram. Im happy with it 😊It's smooth and It's twitter and Instagram together I love it can't wait for It's future but I found the wrong one but then I went to the site to find the real app it needs to be #1 that pops up so people can find itAnd how exactly do I read all the content from ppl I follow when the app decides to refresh itself and only show \"discover\" content that I could not possibly care any less aboutAm the first to write a review on Mark Zuckerberg new app..wowee I had early access to it in the last few day and I think its great. When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish...r u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractiveIt's moderated Twitter as opposed to 4chan esque current Twitter that is nearly impossible to check in public because it's become overrun by hate and bots for a particular blue and white website. DMs coming soon. Users concerned about privacy; if the app is free, you are the product. There isn't anything on this app that is going to know any more about you than the little tracking/gps/algorithm driven device you carry in your pocket everyday already knows.It was fine up until a few minutes ago now it's not opening at all my internet is fine but it won't load anything and shows all the people of my insta followed but i didn'tIt's a waste of time. Firstly, it is a copy of Twitter and secondly, this app is being downloaded only because of Instagram's popularity in everyone's mobile and there is nothing different in it.I see the possibilties here. 1. I would like the block feature to, you know, actually work. 2. Id really like to mostly just the people I follow. Yes, i know, this is software in development, changes will come.This app has massive potential, and even in its current version it's a Twitter heavy hitter. Hashtags and a message link to Instagram would be nice, and word is they are in the works 👍🏽App crash whenever I try to post or reply. I can scroll, read, like, and repost as per normal. Edit: Status quo. Drop to 1 star.The fact that it forces me to see content I don't want gives it a one-star review immediately. I don't want to see any content from anyone other than the followers I have selected.Smooth onboarding and sync with Instagram. But please allow us to pick media from folder other than root galleryAs an early user I'm facing some problem. This app stopped working several times. Not related but the website also haven’t enough info for it’s users.Unable to open the app on my phone, the phone get stuck, and now unable to uninstall it also as the phone hangs and restarts on its own ...Really a great initiative by meta, All about this app - i like the interface, very user Friendly and also i can log in with my insta id , that's gonna be make a huge difference i hope >3I've installed this app for 3 times and still get screen bugs. My phone is using android 9. Please fix it up. ThanksPlease DON'T DOWNLOAD this app DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME This app has same algorithm like Instagram and Facebook it's track location and put all the celebrity on the timeline I needed the people I follow, but this app is BS I recommend do not download this app all the young man out there, don't waste your time on it go and do some push ups instead of wasting time on it specifically young man work on yourself And I'm now sure Mark Zuckerberg matrix agentIt doesn't even work for me well, I always get \"Sorry something went wrong, Please try again!\" like I keep getting this error, please fix it! 😡When I open the app, it got a stroke. I cant use the app because once I scroll it got glitched. Also can't see anything in app. Fix thisI think it should automatically recognize your Instagram password and username. Most of us can't remember that. Have been trying to login for more than two days nowTotally insane this instagram/threads. NEVER had instagram acct. Downloaded threads app, need instagram acct to log in. Set up new acct w instagram Says I have an acct. Reset pwd Now cant log in bcuz of suspicious activity AND all of Instagram emails are in GERMAN ???features that would be great: -translation -private messaging -hiding/ unhiding our IG acc -bookmark/ saves with categories -see the history of our likes -obv, working hashtags -hope it also has nice algorithms based from what we like obv -being able to save imagesLacks privacy options. There is just a private-public account switch, it doesn't even let me choose the display name.A more than wonderful application, easy to use and uncomplicated, unlike many applications, it is wonderful and deserves more than five stars, thanks MarkThe restriction messages are annoying and once they start you won't follow people successfully even when you are logged in. You follow on your endand the person is not followed on the other endGreat onboarding experience! I already like it way better than Twitter. The app works smoothly and is well-designed.For some reason, I cannot use this app properly. It's having a glitch throughout and it's annoying. The whole page is filled with glitches. Please do something about it.This app is awesome but I want one extra feature to chat personal with any person . If the meta team are add this feature. I will greatly thankful for all team of meta.overall good but crashes on honor phones if you try to @ someone directly.. edit: app keeps crashing seemingly randomly not just when you try @ing someoneStripped down, zero ads, focused, clean, and overall very positive. Having a lovely time.Congrats meta👏👏 this is an nice app and it has an aesthetic look compared to Twitter , well done !! But the logo is little annoying and any way your app is greatWhat about privacy? The app is collecting all the private datas such as photos videos location phone numbers email msgs every thing this app has serious privacy issues i would never recommend anyone to use this appI enjoy the app and viewing what is on it, but I can't even post on it. Every time I even attempt to post something it glitches out. So I'm just bummed about that :/I installed this only bc I hate the new Elon Musk contolled Twitter SO much. I'm quite confident that many others feel the same way. I hope it's good, but at least it can't be any worse than the new Twitter. It must be hard to be both a genius and a dope at the same time!nice. but i have a suggestion for you to fix the damn thing where when we delete our reply but under the post it still counted the reply (even when u tryna see it there's none) yes, that. pls remove it, thanks. for a better experienceI posted a thread with attached video file, but after uploading, the sound of video is escap. Hope this problem will solve by thread.. Very disappointed NaitikI just change password from my ig account, and I can't re-login on threads. Even if I tried to logged out and re-login ig 2 times still can't access threads.so far, so good. would be better if we could switch accounts like we do on instagram, with only two clicks.My Threads are crashing. I tried to download it again and again and try to restart my phone. But nothing changed....this app is glitching, i don't know what happened but this app is not working. im trying to use it but it is always glitched. kindly please fix this.Growing pains, but to be expected. Give us a tab or option on the homescreen which shows ONLY the activity from people we're following and I think you'll have a winner. As it stands, my feed is clogged with stuff from people I, frankly, don't care about.A great app as it gives great content like Twitter and a problem i would report is the app doesn't responded when I had to upload a post on it like photos or videos.Where is the edit button? And each time i open an app it says \"posting\" not sure what it is posting each time i open it lol. Fix it up ya'll.Please give option to save images in thread's contents. Also sometimes it's crashing when I open an image in homepage.I guess there's room for improvement... My keyboard is covering what I'm typing... Is that from the app? It's definitely from the app because I experience it only on this app. Kindly look into it. Thank youNice app. Still much to be done. Surely need \"for you\" and \"following\" feature for feed. Smooth refreshing etcIt's tied to Instagram... Uninstalled. I was hesitant anyway because of meta. Is finally woke me up Can't believe all the false positive AI generated reviews. Note: Im not a fan of Twitter.Thread: The future of social networking is here! With its sleek design, seamless navigation, and innovative features, Thread has set a new standard. Connect, share, and engage like never before. Get ready to be hooked! #ThreadApp #GameChangerThis is a really good app, though when I want to upload a photo, it would be really good if I can access albums individuallyVery easy to use and people friendly. I'd like to see the upcoming updates the app would make.It is Absolutly true that instagram always do best for their user but after giving this app they do much better Before I use different different app for shorts and for pictures but now I use single instagram for all and i hope threads is also benificial for myself and now I use threads at the position of twi***The home feed is just a tidal wave of unrelated posts by people I don't follow talking about things I have no interest in. There's no real search, or hashtags or topics. So it's a very unfun experience right now.Threads is such a fun app but yes it can do with a few improvement but for myself it's perfect the way it is. It's definitely a goodbye to Twitter from me 😁Awesome. It's is a nice alternative to the bird app. I think it is safe for teenagers and and very nice and warm user base.Need to add gif replies major thing, perhaps some banner for profiles would be another one, live photos and videos, and DMS. Also major one trending topics, and being able to search for topics not just peopleLove the simplicity of the interface. Video quality is dope too. Kindly work on DMs, Trends and Edit features.So many bugs, the feed will reload under you, you open it and you're back viewing an old thread like it just won't let go.It been barely 5 hours on the app and I can say that it feels like sugar! It's been a thrilling experience. Thank you, Mark Zuckerberg!I can't upload photos or videos. Every time I write a caption, the application immediately exits suddenly, why?Whenever i open Threads app it is showing gliches like one post is scratching whole screen if i try to touch search or account it continues same glich please correct it quickly.Do not download Threads. You will never ever be able to delete it, unless you delete your Instagram. That is 1000% messed up. Now I'm locked in a 360 deal with an app smh. I didn't want to sign-up, I was just checking it out. Now in stuck with it. So sad smh. The things they do. You can only deactivate. But what if I just don't want it. Why y'all do society like that? Have a heart, let us go if we feel like it.My only disappointment so far is not being able to use gifs when leaving a comment on a post. Awkward introverts need a way to communicate without words when brain stops workingits kinda wierd and connecting to instagram with no deletion option independly for it makes it look like a desperate attempt to stay relevant, even though its just been madePlease introduce polls and also allow us DM facilities which can integrate insta and messenger so that we have one unique messenger also include high quality feeds now that we have more stable internet connections. Make sure to create a lite version in the future for 3G gen amd below. More feedback in coming days.. but polls and dm very necessary.I'm unable to login in this app Below message occurred in popup with dismiss option after click dismiss app is crashed This problem is occurred in pixel 7 android version- 13 Error,Please wait a few minutes before you try againAdd true black out black theme. Not this wash out gray stuff. Saw that iphone users have different black. Why didn't you implemented the same true black out black for android as well?When I make a thread with multiple reply inside it (I reply myself to make some kind of narrative). The thread isn't sorted by oldest reply. Sometimes it's just jumping around.Amazing, I love it. Stop using the reviews to request features literally every other app already has and go use those instead. Let us enjoy this! One million stars.Since day one I am using this app ... I don't know what is the use of this app ...whatever I post no one even see my post..no like no comments .. and now there is bug in this app , a am not able to see anything which i uploaded . Its showing me error. . Something went wrong Try again.. what is this now????The apps has alot of upgrades to do, we need to know if a person is following us or not, we can't even see peoples quotes either. Fix upIt was cleand and easy app. But i am experiencing a little bit of diffculty about different nation language. Can you add translation ?Threads be like the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. A new application. We want a new opportunity. Why linked our past on Instagram to this , I was optimistic about the application at first, but now, unfortunately 👎🏻 0It's very good and I love the simplicity of it, I can't wait to see what they add and the changes they make which will improve the overall usability of the app.Works ok, but I'm quite disappointed. I cannot use gifs from my phone keyboard, nor can I post pictures, but I see others doing so.There's no direct message, can't see profile photos, can't search by keywords or hashtags, full of limit.. I hope you can improve base on what i wrote above.While it's still adding features, sure, it's not MuskTwitter and it's pretty close to the old twitter, so enjoy!So much glitch and lag... Automatically turns off and stops responding. Please fix this bug ASAP!Could you please seperate the recommended posts and the ones we follow because if you accidentally refresh and there's no new post it's hard to find the ones you were looking at as it gets filled with recommended onesGetting x-rated posts immediately is not a good sign. Having to delete IG to remove this won't bother me, but might be a big problem for others. Privacy not good eitherAlways show \"Sorry, something went wrong, Try again\" when I click posts. Something always went wrong when I open someone's main.Breath of fresh Air! I never knew just HOW toxic the other app had gotten until I switched to Threads. It's only been a week and everyday it gets better and better.It has still a lot to improve as compared to Twitter... Many features are missing which have to be incorporated.... Hopefully waiting for updatesSuper unstable always keeps crashing while trying to post or repost, I tried posting a photo thrice and it always says post failed to upload and crashesBad interfere, pls fix this for Android 9 version. I connot able to see display is very glitchy.I am the very 1st person using this app at Vivo phone and leaving a review. So exciting and hope that something interesting will be found from this app. Able to post photo using app in iOS but not android.Repeatedly screen blinks whenever I try to open threads. I don't know this happening due to my old phone or anything else.I am facing a Glitch Error in this App since I have downloaded it and it happens when I swipe up, all the text scattered throughout.Slow (4G and 4 GB RAM, Android 10) to load, can't save pictures or videos. Massive potentialNew user of Threads. Pretty nice app. Much better than Twitter. With more updates & features, this app will be about as good as they come. Keep the features & updates rolling...Love the potential, but for now it's a 3 star because the app keeps crashing when I'm trying to comment or mention anyone in my post.Off to a good start. Instagram integration is excellent. Desperately needs a \"only people I follow\" feed though.user friendly, i just hope it also display in the profile the number of followings, and the message button to start the conversation with others. nice app!Missing a lot of features at the moment DMs, Gifs, following feed, save images and videos, bookmarks, a desktop site but that probably won't be for a whileThis app has a lot of potential and there's definitely some room for improvement. I just wish on the next update they would add the dark mode thingieThe feed is full of glitch. Whenever I enter I only see glitches. But I'm sure it will fixed and we'll get a stable app.And then I ll rate it five stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐the videos in my home page sometimes cannot be heard or they dont work correctly. im currently using s22. please fix it asap.Need dislike and I don't like it functionality, to improve recommendations for my comfort. I don't like to see and block all the stupid celebrities ind influencersIt's nice. The idea is good but why can't we delete our accounts without deleting our Instagram accounts? Why is there no DM yet? No trend table? Voice threads? A lot has to be done but let's give you guys timeI never liked Twitter and Instagram for too much clutter so I just downloaded the Threads but it has strings attached to login using Instagram actt.. ooops. I have uninstalled the Threads and be happy without any app still giving 4**** be happyLol, tried to login with Instagram. They sent a 6 digit OTP and are requesting 8 digit code in app. Didn't expect meta to submit app with such issues.I can't post pics. It always say \"failed to upload\". All my other friends didn't experience this problem.Hi the app is very good ,but pleas update dark mode and bright mode options, if there is bright mode it's good to use on day time , Thanks and it's very usefull appI would give 5 star to this app but i am not giving because when I scroll the home feed all the text start shivering it is not working properly in my phone please do something meta thanks.Sorry, something went wrong. This is what I get for a week, tried reinstall and clear cache. This app was promising at the beginningA refreshing social network that I truly need! Hopefully, the positivity and good vibes from this app will continue throughout the journey.. Better than than Twitter toxic community app! Definitely must try.A very great alternative to twitter we've all been waiting for, and it's really great that it's linked with instagram. I'm really happy with this and I can't wait to see where this goes.My experience with the app has been okay...... But everytime I Try to post recently it just keep shutting down..... Especially when I try to post an image or a VideoSo far good in its launch but whenever I select a photo the app crashes, hopefully you fix this issue soon.This app bugs!! I reinstalled it like 3 times but still I'm unable to add pictures in the thread.It's full of people I don't care about, I don't follow them yet still appear in my feed. Very few options in the so-called fediverse app.This app has a Chinese tracker built in. It says it's safe but it isn't!! I was being tracked secretly. My phone says this app has been using my location 24/7. DELETE THIS APP IMMEDIATELY!!!App keeps closing when I try to comment on a post, I've read on fb that others are experiencing the same issue. Is there a fix coming?This is so much user friendly than alternative apps. I generally don't like Facebook, but this is solid so far. Elon Musk sucks.I like this app so much because it is well organised but you add some feature translation for comments,post, collection post and download for pictures so that it will be more easy to use this appIts fine and acts as a really basic form of social media but good god is it missing some core creature comforts, like at minimum just being able to curate your feed to ignore anyone you dont follow or aren't in your relevant interests is a must for any platform..Useless app. What purpose does it serve?The same dumb instagram audiences on this app, same type of content, nothing special. Doesn't even come close to twitter in terms of the content and the intellectual type of audience. Another thing to waste time on.Im unable to use this app ,Im installing and deleting it for so many times but still whenever i open it there some glitche happening its have been more than 4/5 days i think still the glitch is happeningSo far so good! Apart from a few changes that they've said are in the pipeline this app is very promising, plus it's not twitter which is a bonusIt's quite easy to use without any complications. I would say this app is the best as a replacement of Twitter, that's for sure.It's a great start, however, needs some tweaking. We are all used to Twitter and what it does, so I understand this app can't do EXACTLY what it does, because it will simply be Twitter again 🤷🏽‍♀️. So hopefully this app will come with BETTER ideas for people to continue using.great app, need tab about to see the following thread only, and explore of course, and need TREND tab so we can know what the trend or viral right time.You have 0 control over what shows on your feed, and the algorithm seems to be very centerlized. It's just another Facebook feed basicallyCould you please make the switch account like instagram? It's really bothersome to log out each account because we always get notification for login attempt via email.Has the potential to replace Twitter but so far it's missing a lot of crucial features such as translation, top comments shown on top, trending page etc. I'd give it a 5/10I literally can't look at my account and the stuff I've posted or the notifications. Keeps saying 'something went wrong'It's nice to have an alternative to Twitter, but I feel a lot needs to happen to make it a viable competitor. Great starting point though!Like the purpose but unable to see any replies, likes, notifications etc. Just get a message saying 'something went wrong. Please try again'.Very bad experience withth the app it's shaking and getting blur over all display experience was very bad... !!I like the idea. But the app keeps crashing and it's incredibly buggy. Please fix itThis is simply a thread. This app is immersive. This app makes you feel like a thread. A solid 9/10. Need to add different varieties of threads and different colours of threads.Good app and id be happy to move over from Twitter but i get *A TON* of absolute random posts from pages i dont follow and have no interest in. Just show me the pages i follow and we'll have a dealIt should be having a personal messaging feature also.. I totally loved this app and it's just fab 😍 Just the above mentioned update can make it perfect 😃It's filled with glitches, my whole screen glitches everything I open the app. And when I tried deleteing the threads account, it says my Instagram account will be deleted with it. Please fix it and I might change my review.When I try to write a post the app shuts down. It's done it 3 times in a row now. It's the latest version and fully updated.User Interface in Dark mode needs to be improved... It's not as easy as Instagram for human eyes....The app was good but still needs a lots of facility and feature update!!! And pls enable Multiple ACCOUNTS sinking options that you've made bw FB and insta!!!ITS GOOOOOOOD and there's still a lot more room for improvement. I really wish they'd add a pin feature! :'>Excited and confused, it is almost similar to Twitter, not sure what difference it is going to offer compared to Twitter. For now one thing I am badly missing is an option to book marking a threadI would like to see more features: option to have poll , add #hashtag , whom I can see Thier threads, option to edit a thread , option for reaction more than like , option to have more than one thread account if I have more than one Instagram account. All these are currently missingAnnoying like Instagram. Spending all day muting people I don't wanna see. Can't change color theme. Like Twitter but with more noise and less control.1) The app should have DM's (Direct Messages). 2) The app should be COMPLETELY End-to-End Encrypted by default!! 3) The app should have \"Following\" also, not only \"Followers\". 4) The app should have a dark theme like on WhatsApp.It's still buggy on my end. Cant even view my feeds cause I might be using old smartphone, Redmi Note 5, android 9. Will change if its working properly.Promising, just needs Instagrams dms and gif comments built in(also bookmarks). One thing they have fixed though is no auto refresh the moment you get to the topJust a boring app, there's no discovery through topics, you just get posts from influencers meta wants you to follow, and not based on your interests.I couldnt post or see other stuffs. The same \"failed to upload \" thing . I did reinstall the app again but it didn't work. This is not how you win over twitterHave notifications TURNED ON and ALLOWED in the settings yet not getting any notifications. Escalating this issue up higher.I enjoyed this app so much. Its has a number of positive outcomes. Obviously I recommended this app. But Threads need to more improvement, like privacy, following system, hashtag and so...on. I hope you will fix it.Your application don't work properly. It's home screen will speedly shaking. Please fix this issue.easy to use better than twitter. no bots or scam people on it 。when the gonna add some features like hashtag , trending more... it's gonna be perfect .What should I say enjoying using threads or enjoying sewing (🧵🪡) Threads 😆?. Jokes a part Really trying something new and clean . Hope the traffic and the system properties work okh in all conditions also don't want any kind of disturbing ads.overall Enjoying 🧵🪡.(Threads)It's a nonsense app. It's true that anyone who doesn't have an Instagram account can't localize it. It's completely uselessGreat fresh start . UI is Fine and app performance is ok. overall a good app to spend time on , really love new algorithm of reach. i hope this app get updated and not be an twitterGUI of app is very neat and attractive in the term of simplicity. Loved it... Suggestions: 1. There should be unread thread badge... 2. Unread Threads should be viewed by scrolling down... 3. Translation for all languages should be made available... 4. Top trending threads in the term of hashtags should displayed...Buggy mess. There are graphical bugs whenever the screen is basically updated.It's a simple wow experience. No chit chat only post and value and experience sharing..love it..hope to see new features in upcoming update.Very good for a first release, and bugs are being fixed noticeably quickly.Good app so far I have used it for 10 hours it's amazing a few things to be included in future update like messaging, tagging in photos.This app is not supported in my mobile (redmi y2). It's like fully messed. If image option is there in this review means, I'll share a screenshot.Its okay but it wont let me post old and new photos without kicking me out the app. I also hate how we can only serch through gallary instead of searching through other files for inages.I'm getting serious glitches on this app. Texts and images overlapping each other. I can't see anything.Appalling app. Impossible to post - \"something went wrong\" - and impossible to see reactions - \"something went wrong\". Back to Mastodon.Please move the post button to the top. My keyboard covers the button up on screen and maybe make the icons bigger or darker so we can see the functions better.Almost perff Pls add the option to edit the text and this app is golden! Love that it doesnt have DMs too. Reduces the oversaturated and unnecessary convosIt's decent. No iPad app is kind of lame. I wish my 'home' feed had an option to view posts from people I follow and not random accounts.So far it's good but I think it needs to personalize your feeds and also had a Direct Message option kos I can't be going to Instagram anytime time I want to a have a private conversation with my threads followersOne of my main reasons for liking Twitter was to follow great journalists and hear and share breaking news, but since Threads has banned Canadian news I don't see a reason to bother trying it out.Can you please do something about options for Gifs also notification does nothing.. fix that. An edit option would be helpful as well.Apparently this app doesn't refresh by itself and keeps showing old posts. Even if I refresh it's incredibly slow to do so.We need the translation feature that exists on ig. Also, it'd be cool to get the trending now feature or something similarplz add a change between accounts feature because when i try to log in and out of accounts, the app crashes and has to be uninstalled and reinstalledIt's addicting. Great app for socializing. I hope you will add a #hashtag feature, where text with # is highlighted or can be clicked.Can't see comments, profile sections. Constantly seeing something went wrong try again later. This is happening for the last 3-4 days.Need multi account same as Instagram ! I am having one personal and one business accounts in Instagram where i can switch between but in Threads there is no switch option !Great app. I love the change of social media space... I just hope the install and update options are improving.Needs a trending/what's hot page, needs tags or a good search topic function, needs chronological feed and a following tab. Way better than bird app from muskratPeople saying this is a twitter killer I think it will be both Instagram and twitter killer this app is fantastic but needs more features but I know head of Instagram said theres a lot of ideas on the table can't wait to see them ideasWhen I log in to instagram, the threads log out. Vice versa. Because of this, my instagram was violated and I couldn't interact with my friends.I can't even comment, like or follow. Fix this issue because I can't open my threads, because I might log out of my instagram again and increase my violation.Version 1 is ok Bug I've noticed is when I click notifications where multiple people liked one of my posts, the app crashes (Android)This app is a great alternative to Twitter. You're not bombarded with ads in Threads. With Twitter, ads are unbearable even as a Twitter Blue subscriber. I'll be spending more of my time on Threads as time goes by because Elon has truly made Twitter even more of a cesspool.My profile and activity pages don't work even after reinstalling the app again, not sure what's wrong. Is it possible to fix it?Not a very well thought out app, looks like a cheap twitter knock off, plus like all other Marks app it will be full of child pr0n within a month or two.I just installed it and it just overlaps evrything I wish I could add a image here. Every option I open is getting overlapped and looks weirdI love the app but all of a sudden I can't see or make posts and even my profile is blank, I can't see my followers or following nor all the posts I have made. It's annoyingThis poses no threat to Twitter nor will it be a replacement. No direct messaging, no chrono feed, no way to filter to who I'm following so for every thread by someone I do follow, I have to scroll past 1000x more of celebrity boasting & flexing & harbl-measuring.I'm on Android phone. Why can't I upload a pic to threads? I could yesterday. Now when I try to add a pic, the app just closes.There are lot of glitches happening in my phone, promninent one is layers of interface going over one another. Please fix this.It would have been much more better,but it doesn't have a personal message option for users except posting. I hope they bring that soon.It's great but it could really use a trending tab in the search tab to search keywords. That would be awesomeLacks features such as bookmarks, see thread likes, translation threads, and many more, please release these features soon so that this app can replace that blue bird appSo far, it's a really good alternative to Twitter. I despise Elon and very hopeful for this app. You need to change the policy of having to delete IG if you delete Threads though.I am really enjoying the new app. The interface is good and user friendly. The feel is better than TwitterGreat app o also waiting to fix the hashtag option and trend page also will be nice if we can join same all our Facebook friends or follower as instegram and option to share any video to another app or downloa I have great suggestions to give the first all first 50 millions the Install it and use it the blue confirm they deserve it because they trust and make other trustThe app is good but i think there should be an option for pinning threads on a person's profile and also the time that feed takes to load is slowContinue crashing when I upload 5 or more photos or videos. Update take time. Please fix this issue and add edit button.Pretty barebone right now although it got potential. I wish they'd let us change our handles separately from Instagram. Will be interesting how it'll fare against Twitter however.Not bad but still needs a ton of improvement. For example fixing the timeline.The app is very good and lovely but it need some modification such as dark mode, DM, etc.Need to improve a lot , unable to post a picture its always failing to upload , tried almost 10-15 times yet not being able to upload a pictureAmazing app. It needs more clutter and improved UI. And don't forget to add Dark Mode.App not working all content messing up clustering into each other and text is overlaying multiple time I tried several time same happened please fix itWhy u need to attached this with Instagram. U can make it an individual app. With the feature of reddit and Twitter. Also include the trending option from Twitter. That will be more accurate for threads.Cool rollout with lots of room for improvement. Does give me Twitter c2008 vibes, and I'm here for it. Pack in more features, and that score will increase for sure.Sounds simple, clear, and innovative. It would have been better if there hadn't been a footprint of photos and videos.The app is simple, but why can't you save pictures. That's what was annoying about Instagram.I like the concept, it reminds me of Twitter. but the feed won't work properly it keeps glitching whenever I try to scroll 😔Constantly crashing on my device. Need to split between followed feed and suggested feed.Very bugged. Unable to switch accounts without logging out. Also always crashingThe App crashes again and again, think the developer for to give it the testing team, and push it to live. I'll download the next public release.Doesn't have dark mode on android...the basic feature nowadays. Cannot open Help Centre. Terrible. Plz bring dark mode then i might start using it.App constantly crashing when trying to comment on threads, also whenever tagging an account it's just crashes straight away. Huawei P20 Pro.It's not even working just flashes texts and images evertime I scroll making it pathetically tough to use. For me, solve this glitch and take 5 stars that's all 🙌🏼They need to add a DM button, saving a picture button, also people should be able to change their Threads username withiut changing that of Instagram and the profile picture too.First make this app to adapt themed icons for Android 13 (Google Pixel) and INSTAGRAM TOO.... Please sort out the Home Page. I want similar home feed like twitter (Following and For You). Dont make this home feed like Instagram Home Feed, full cluter. Threads need what is trending right now, '#' has no value right nowIf you don't have an Instagram account already, you cannot even login to this app! There is no option to create an account here. Uninstalled.very poor app and can't access it. They asked to access via Instagram and can't work. Not convenient app and wasted of time to deal with.It's good bt it's not better it needs more 1)twitter has editing bt u can't edit here 2)app crashing 3)where is the dm? 4) reloading the page...... I'll keep updating more bt till now I'll give it an 8/10 pls fix it mr ZuckerbergVidéos on my Threads app has not been talking, just watching movements but couldn't hear anything even after trying out different buttons that could help.I think it's need more things like add music, filters. Btw it's a good social media platform . 🥰Great app, awesome UI and UX, slight improvements needed, but it's the first day of Threads and I'm already loving it! :)No more constant twitter promotions. Wish it was chronological time line so I could receive breaking news and from only those I follow.Whenever I'm going to open the app.. It's not opening properly... I don't know what happening... Plz fix the bug!!Crashes like no other!! I could hardly. Post any thing without crashing every single time!!Worst app tbh as soon as I opened the app all the content was overlapping each other I couldn't even use it.. I installed it again but still the sameNot bad, just please make it easier to switch accounts. Hate logging in and out to switch accounts.It is better to swipe left or right to hide or mute options, and please add a dark theme. Thank you.Buggy app. Image quality is degrading too much. Uploading video and audio is missing.I feel that the app coukd be better like having a way to show me threads by the people I follow not just one chaotic mess of tweets and replies but I have hope this will evolve into something brilliant its definitely been a long time coming thank youhaven’t seen any bug untill now but the scrolling animation is too much laggy and it feels too much annoying. this should be 120fps like meta's other app.The potential is there but it's really bland and buggy. Feels like a early Twitter and is definitely the lesser.Smooth, 1st gen, lots of features on the way, but very smooth.This app shows a glitch on my device whenever I scroll down to read more it just get hang and the entire text become unreadableNeeds translate integration ASAP. No reason in 2023 for it not to be there. Update: Keeps crashing. Bugs galore.Can't differentiate this app with Instagram app coz they are all the same. I think I gonna uninstall it and go back to my usual Instagram app they binded together.This app really needs improvement. Because after opening threads, my instagram account cannot be opened. It always sunddenly closes.This app is bound to fail. Most of the features are Instagram-centric. This app does not have any unique features.It's buggy. I opened the app and it immediately lagged and started bugging. I can't do anything.i love it so far, although my only problem is that i can't see who i already followed back and who i haven't. but so far so good, feels like a safe space for everyone that needs a social media to be free from toxic peopleLove the clean app. Dislike the non-chronological timeline and the feed full of people that I don't know.DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THREADS!!! Once you create an account with threads you are not able to delete just threads but you will be prompted to delete your Instagram account. Additionally, hashtagging topics or items does not work. Wait to sign up until it is a viable platform as of right now it's not worth it.It's a wonderful social media platform. I can link my Instagram profile and that's amazing. Well move Mark!!Provide edit function. I just committed a type. I want to get it rectified. Please provide edit functionality for a min or two so that I can do it.The app works well, but I don't see myself using this at all until there is a way to see only what I want to see, in a chronological order. Or at least limit it somehow.Why is it showing you've been logged out of %1$s.the account owner may have changed the password man I haven't done it I tryed everything uninstalling & clearing cache what more am I supposed to do man just fed upReally feels clean and smooth to use, unlike Twitter, but im waiting for the features. If they do, i think this will beat Twitter for sure.Pretty good, but need to be able to see like numbers and a greyer theme would be better, current one is jarringly blackA missed opportunity to give more control back to users and empower them to connect; zero options to customize my feed to avoid random content.I Def think it needs a translation button incase your following someone that doesn't type English and u would have to copy the sentence then search it up but all in all I love itApp looks and runs great. Only problem I have is that I'm not getting post notifications for profiles I have them enabled forSo much better than the bird app. They are adding new functionality every week, just give it time.I downloaded the application and logged in, but it does not work when using it, strange things occur on the screenJust downloaded the app, I just hope we will get the translation option as I follow people who post in languages that I don't read or speak. Thank youUI is not coming properly. It's blurry can't read anything. So, please help me to fix it asapBetter than twitter, i guess. This app will give you intagram-like interface with improved overall appearance than twitter does. Wonderful! Thank u Zuck!Can't upload photos, don't know about anything else but whenever I try to upload a photo it crashes without having a chance to postFantastic. Love it so far but it needs built in translation please. Thank you so much for a great app.I have a issue with this app please its verry annoying I use my same account for this app that I use for Instagram however after changing my profile picture on IG and my user name why doesnt it change on Threads also?Please fix the error.Timeline needs to be with only people we follow. Also, every time I log in to the app, I get logged out from the Instagram app!The app is awesom.. but the srolling sucks.. in my device.. sometime before insta had same problem but after an update.. its smooth.. please resolve this..Nice user experience, but should be improved. Add the following; 1. Edit button 2. DM button 3. Migrate Instagram followers seemlessly 4. Allow post pinning.i don't know why is it getting glitch!!! the page does not get loaded and so many pages at a time get opened!!!This is way better than Twitter. But, I have an issue, it's not \"smooth\" enough, idk what it is. Also needs dark modePin posts, chronological timeline of people you follow (very important), activitypub when, unthreading from Instagram in future. Please make this feature full appThis app keeps crashing and states the password may have changed. I cleared my cache on my Samsung Android phone.\"something went wrong\" flashes followed by a black screen. Happens on 2 Android devices and 1 iOS.It's ok though but still there is no option to disable the auto-play the videos. Please provide an option for this.It has a lot of potential but please let me upload videos every time i try it says \"failed to load try again\" on and on and onI experience random crashes sometimes when I click on the view replies button on a thread. Everything else is perfectGood start. But the algorithm pushes a bit too many ru$$ians, and the app crashes a bitA good start but but desperately needs a \"following\" tab. The way the feed works right now is not niche friendly.Not to bad. So much unwanted content in the feed. But very few scam/phishing attempts so far.It's missing some core features. But it's not full of fascists. Looks better than Twitter tooI hate Twitter with passion, but this one is so good and very interactive, my first few hours on the app I was surrounded with comedy and every content I needed, welldone Mark ZuckerbergCan you give a like button !! More accessible or by a gesture like Instagram. By double tapping the post...It's fine besides not having a chronological timeline. If there's big breaking news you'll miss it.Need the option for switching into other accounts like Instagram, it's quite a hassle, after being addicted to easy switch method in InstagramThe algorithm is not that great yet. Why am I seeing threads from celebs that I don't necessarily follow? It was nice for a while then poof random celeb threads appeared and I simply hated it. I wish there was a way to only see threads from people you follow.This has been a fantastic v1.0 experience. App is stable, easy to understand, and has been fun to use.Wooooooow I love the original Instagram but this is a miss. Twitter has state of the art specs that threads has a long way to achieveWas a great app for the first year, seems to have a lot of bugs but I believe it has potential. and am the first to review it🤞🏼Don't get me wrong, it's a good app, but it's next to impossible to use on my phone, it keeps glitching like crazy, and I've tried as many things as I can.Not good, it requires an Instagram account, totally unsafe, your public opinion linked to you cellphone number, your personal information made public.It's need improvement as It is very slow to check followers and it takes very much time to upload image or video and don't show percentage of upload in notication in uiNot even used a single second properly after installing. Too much glitch. Nothing is visible clearly. Please do somethingStability is terrible, app seems fun though. Lots of activity and getting plenty of support by users.i have an issue while seeing the data. contacted for support through given mail address but no response...... still waiting to see hiw was the applicationExcellent app. But try to make media autoplay optional. It consume lots of data.It's good. You should have a way to stop videos auto playing especially when using mobile phone data.Doesn't support all kinds of phones/versions on Android platform. The UI is unstable...Very good and addictive interface but sometimes it doesn't load any threads .... Which makes it frustrating one 😩FIRST REVIEW ON THREADS ever. Interface wise it looks similar to Instagram, yet to understand the purpose, will update you soon one I use it, FIRST RewVery great up! Theres a little bugs but it runs smoothly! Very very smooth. More updates please!Can't open a new account. You can only use an instagram account which I don't want. This is not an independent app.Can't sign up without an Instagram account. Not signing up to that rubbish app again. Will stay with the real Twitter quite happily.Edited version: 3 star lang. There's no translation 😢 Aside from that, cannot edit once you click the \"post.\" 😢😢Hi dev team I downloaded this app, and I have been trying to login with ig as requested but it always fails saying there's a problem trying to be fixed. What's the problem?It great Meta taking next stages about social media but there's minus that annyoing, yesterday when I upload a video it doesn't sound,I can't reply with media in comment.If you launch this app to compete the twitter then need to work hard ... After spending 30 minutes I found this app boring from logo to interface ... Near to me this app is only for gathering info nothing else ... This is a new way to find People's at one forum ... Twitter is far away from Threads ... Threads logo has threatening feels ... Scary 😳I think it's very good for us bts army because we can share or know about bts information,chats, voting's notice etc.... And it's very good for knowing every small details about bts or any other k-pop group... 🙂i think its an great app but lot of room for improvement. I hope you guys will add amazing futures in it like dm, hastags more and more feep up the good work.Glitch is one word for this. Couldn't use and explore the app due to shaking screen that pops up while scrolling.Works seamlessly for me with no errors. Quick easy access to the functions I use most often.Uploads are failing, automatic 1:1 cropping of photos, cannot choose other folders than the camera's default folderIt was released 14 hours ago and I haven't noticed any major bugs, it has a very good Ui and very simple to use. Glad to be in the first 100k usersi don't like home page. i just want to see my following content and theirs related. and more things please update privacy setting and translate setting.Finally, a worthy competitor for Threads. Not that Meta is that much better either, but real competition is good competition. Hope this app succeeds to put Twitter back on their feet.When i upload a video, i dont see a sound button for some android user, please fixed it. Overall its great appNeeds improvement while scrolling for older Android devices (Android 7) , Need a Seperate dark mode toggle.What a drama Because one app not start without another app. Mean that we cannot login without instgram. If instragram not open with out wattsap and .......... how long chain if this way.....Twitter copy but with few updates and different name that's all not good app crashes alot and nothing new or exciting just an app to cover your phone memory better to stick with old apps and play gamesumm, am i the only one who's experiencing a force close bug when trying to click on repost notifications? it's happened all the time smh.Super cool so far. Looking forward to them adding search, hashtags, and better feeds. So far so good!It's a total copy of Twitter. Infact Twitter has more features than threads like you can save photos in Twitter but this feature is not available in threads.same algorithms, same content so nothing new. when all meta use same algorithms across their social media what's the point of adding another.Excellent app, user-friendly, good user interface, easy access 👌 👍 😀. This new space is the less anticipated but best platform ever. The engineers ♥️ 😳 😍 ❤️ are wow 👌 👏 😍 👍It's very glitchy that I can't see things properly. It's all repeated and stacked on eachother whenever I scroll.I would give it a 4 star bcz it's overall a good experience, but I hope it doesn't allow trash like they did with FB and Instagram 🙏 please maintain it standardI literally just installed this app and it won't even let me open it. It says the app is updating right now to try again later. How is the app updating if I literally just downloaded it?The thing is i was really excited to try threads but when I downloaded it on my Samsung tablet it had grafical error it was just broken I am redownloading it to see if the issue is still there if is I will edit thisGood, but I just wish there was an easier way to access specific folders in your gallery, or post GIFs.First of all it's great tbh of course it needs some work to be done but it's very new and u can report anything and they fix it fast how far it goes for me as a new app it's amazingHas potential to dethrone a big rival. I hope it does. But please introduce a translation function.Nothing special just copied some features from Twitter. It would be better If Zuck also copy hashtag and trending feature from Twitter. I am disappointed because of this🤬We need a translate button just like the instagram did. I got a trouble to know the meaning of somebody's threads. He speaks japanese any way, i speak javanese, completely incomprehensible. So please add those button.Why does this even exist? It's literally the same as my instagram feed; same people, same accounts, same posts... for what? I already have instagram. Also the terms are extremely invasive of personal info. No thanks! Uninstalled.This app is impressive. But if you put the setting like ig following and favourites. It would be amazing.It's decent but why use data form Instagram Even if you have more followers from Instagram but moving to threads mean you probably have to start at square one, no limits here.Nice but still has a bit of a long way to go,needs to have a separate followings timeline, and to stop importing people from InstagramNot bad. It's a hybrid of Instagram and Twitter. So far so good, interested to see the reputation this app builds.It's okay ,But not good as Twitter, i definitely know that only the \" Instagram\" users will use this app , The twitter user were not interested to use this app , this app only get the numbers of members but not the regular users, This app didn't gives us an interest to use the features, It doesn't have \"DM's , Hashtags and it doesn't differ the media and threads like Twitter does . It's a major issues to use this app. By the way , many people are using this app but it doesn't keep like thisThis app need an immediate update for mid range phone, the app is so laggy right now, i know this app at it's very early face but fix this asap.good app but please fix bugs. theres a bug where it syncs your actuals instagram account it crashes a lotKinda Clean UI Better Than Twitter but needs a bit more updates too make it Twitter level....maybe add chats and input stories and maybe a space update which was in Twitter. And for love of god pls do NOT ADD ADS IN THIS LET IT BE THIS CLEAN UIThis is really good just not like Twitter! I really loved the animation while opening the specific image on Threads!It's taking 24-48 hours to get notification for posts from people I follow. Also it needs a following feed, without it the app is useless.All the pages are overlapping for me and too many bugs..please look into this matter and fix it.Thankyou.Literal rip off of something that's better already. This is a clandestine safe space akin to qanon tards. A liberal blue hair safe space. No thanks. I'll stick to twitter which finally had balance.Threads is like a child of Twitter and Instagram. It has similar features like Twitter. But there are no concept of hastag,users can't see trending topics. News feed isn't so customizable,user has to see some random post even if they don't follow that influencers.The app keeps stopping, the replies on a post are repeated while scrolling then the app closes and it is not easy to find friend's posts and profilesStill trying to hanging with #strings, it will be too early to sail with #threads #java By the way #fb is also started with poor features where orkut used to rock - where is the future now? Didn't like this version of TI've been using from couple days... it's found good...Sometimes little lagging is there while loading/opening threads apart from that, all feels okay....cheers to the team :)It gives you the option to follow people, but your feed will continue to display any post from any user on the platform making following people completely pointlessCan't search specific topic here. No trending topic, means hard to follow the life-trend with this platform. I only able to see random posts from people.I don't want to see posts from random accounts that I don't follow, it's frustrating. Please fix that, and then I might consider going back to the appIt's nice so far. I would like to suggest you to add the \"download button\" on pictures and videos.I absolutely love it so far. I'm still gonna experiment with uploading pictures but so far it's so much better than Twitter.Copycat of Twitter, lacks innovation, redundant n huge privacy issues. App crashes. Going back to Twitter. Support innovation NOT theft!Excellent so far! Really enjoying it. Looking forward to upcoming updates and meaningful conversations!It's app little bit good but they many bug's like ishu and also .. big link with Instagram. we don't want to link thread on Instagram.Tamil language option is not available in the app. India is not only about Hindi, we have 22 recognised languages.First of all, i don't want to see other people idiot horrendous thread post, second...don't make the timeline randomize the ordering everytime i open the app like twt :/Amazing experience so far but it really needs some basic stuff like gifs etc. I really hope we see more updates soon.Loving the app so far alot better than twitter even though their are less features the community is alot better and growing is easier and it is refreshing to have a twitter competitor definitely recommendIt just launched today, I would say it's not better than Twitter but i see it easily becoming a great rival to it probably in the next few months, until now i would say it's pretty good :)If you're looking for a private, personal social media app for your closest friends, then Threads is the app for you. Download it today!Good app. The reason for the missing star is searching function only works about half the time.The feed is essentially \"For You\" from Twitter. I only want to see posts from people I follow. Also, customization options would be nice.It doesn't supports multiple accounts,I can't switch to a different accounts like I can on Instagram by double tapping on my profile.I think I like this app it's very informal, the best thing is that there is no private message section, the most important thing is that I enjoy my time spent in this appFull of recommendations and not the people I'm following, no chronological timeline. Is this a joke? Make a real app. Deleting until fixed.Unstable. Not able to even read anything. Screen gets blurr and cannot get stable.I love this app already. I don't need to create another account all I so is use my insta account and I can still follow the same people and it's straight forward easy to useFun, but lots of room for improvement, since its only a few days old will probbaly be much better over the next few monthsThe application was not working well.when I was it's showing nothing just scraching.not proper working.very bad experience.better to use Instagram...APP has glitched my insta, Cant even log on my account anymore on the mobile app. it keeps crashing Where the hell is the fix for this?This app feels like I am using Diet or sugar free version of twitter, it feels so bland. The app is so desperate that it keeps recommending me out of touch content. I really gave this an honest try, but it just feels so disgusting. The majority of the posts that I saw were people bashing the thread app and its logo. Now I will delete this app in peace, and so I won't have any FOMO.Love the concept of the app but I can't post anything without the app closing down! Very frustrating!I rubbish this application. Zuckerberg comes up with applications which are not secure. Thread is just as good as thrush. Very useless app. Anyway I'm a First Kenyan to write this factLove how there's no ads ... yet. Reminds me of old chat rooms in the 90s. It'll get better!Not working smoothly, no option to login with email, it should be separately signup option without Instagram. Feed not working fine..A new application, a new means of communication. I hope it will be a useful application for knowledge and not for wasting timeThe app is continously crashing, I can only like or reblog, not write or post on my own, everyone is bringing drama from Twitter or posting about it and I see Threads is trying to be a mix of Tumblr and Twitter 😒🙄 Those of us who've been on Tumblr since '09. can't care much for it.Just getting the initial experience. everything is going well at the moment. There will be more changes and hopefully good changesIt's all good , but there is one problem . It is not updating Bio . Whenever I am trying to update my bio , it always says do it after sometime . I was happily using the app , but this made me very upset with the app . Do something or I will not use it .I really like this feature! Of course, coming from Twitter, I'd like to see an explore page or a hastag page!almost good, just need more features like gif supported, gallery pick, and smoother experience in android based phoneI mean it's alright. It does crash wherever I try to post a photo and there's also no options for gifs :(I dont know why, but i could imagine your logo to be rainbow line (matching instagram) on black instead of white line on black background.. but white on black is pretty too☺️Need multi-account switching ASAP. Something similar to the native Instagram build is ideal. 👌🏾Smooth and easy to interact with. Every one is friendly lol, I hope it stays that way!!!Enthusiastic beginning but somehow it feels like Instagram revamped. If only it is possible to reshape it...Seems great. Still a long process to greatness. Please fix the notifications. I want my Woj and Shams alerts.Twitter Wannabe. Please, at least provide something different. This is just a cheap copy of Twitter. Elon does it better. It's too funny that Meta is actually just copy pasting Twitter. Cheap copy. Weak. Useless. Nothing new. Where are the new innovative ideas. Boring and childish behaviour from a huge company just copy pasting another companies ideas. Laughable 3 thumbs down 👎Nice experience on this app. But it keeps crashing when i am posting a photo. Pls fix this.It's still new and fun. Expecting more features. It's a knockout on Twitter. I guess, soGood app, a challenge for twitter. Only 1 thing to improve in this app is to find nearby or same city and state people for suggestion listVery poor nothing new on it still Twiter much better and far away from this app.. I think there must be a new and smart concept to attract users.At this current form I am liking it. The interface is nice. Looks fantastic. Hopefully it will be better than Twitter.Major features are missing - 1. No hashtags 2. Search only brings back accounts to follow...it should show relevant posts. 3. No trendingIts really good alternative for Twitter. Would love to have features like pinning the thread , continue the thread after posting . This would be a real help if they could bring features like thisThe app is very buggy and the UI elements overlap on one another when scrolled.Buggy. Crashes when trying to read big conversation threads. Oh the irony. Said cache was full. Emptied it. Still resetAlready better than the blue one, It is a great app nice to use doesn't consumes data, Download, Join and Thank me later. A Thread🤌🏼🥹It closes when I'm writing a post. My feed is too random. The post button should be top right. Please upgrade it better :) it's fun tho.Bring in switch accounts like Instagram. Remove numbering in Instagram even though it can be hidden. Do something creative!I deleted my instagram account years ago when facebook acquired it. I don't want to create one to use this app. Not to mention, my preferred handle is currently squatted. Anyways. Good luck.Not Like Twitter, not even closer to it. You should bring something different from Twitter. It feels like we are using a copy.App crashes everytime I attempt to create a thread with 2 or more images. Otherwise very fun appNice app. I didn't see many features yet and didn't see an option to add few accounts. It didn't get all my accounts from IGSome technical error unable to edit the dp or any new update in bio. Whatever is been imported from insta is non editable.The home screen just loads a blank black screen not matter how many people I follow. I thought it would at least load news threads day one.Love the app, but it crashes randomly when I try to post comments. Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this?No Translation Feature. I understand it was being rushed out but thus needed to be available immediately.the apps not support on old device, have so many glitch on screen while \"scroll up and down\" and change to other panel button.Very bad experience 😕 all texts are shaking. At first fixed the problem and then realise again 😤The app is nice and simple. I just have a concern, I hope the Threads that will appear in my feed is from the people that I followed so that it'll make sense. Bcs what's that point in following someone if I can see Threads in my feed from people that I don't follow. I hope you'll have an update for this. Thank you.App is lagging in my device(redmi y2)! Home screen content shattering so badly on display! Please fix this bug!In light of the recent restrictions and policies implemented on Twitter, the emergence of Threads appears to be a strategically advantageous move. The timing of its arrival aligns well with the current landscape, leading me to strongly believe that Threads has the potential to surpass Twitter within a few months.Everything on the internet is being connected to each other whether it's an app or a person, just waiting for the end of all these scenarios! Fri, 7Jul,2023.So far, a solid alternative to Twitter, can't wait for new features and fixes that'll truly take Threads to the next level in social mediaMeh, same forced showing of celebs, sports, and people you don't follow that Instagram does. If you could remove suggested content it would be four stars.It would be great if there are: 1) enable searching for keywords 2) has 'media' column on profile feed 3) show the number of people repost on a postIt's kinda laggy in my Android 9. Sometimes, reply box is covered by the keyboard layout & can't be scrolled down either.The app is fun to use but it keeps crashing. I have the same problem with Instagram too.Great app but no themes Only dark them and there is no data save like autoplay you can't control it to never or something I hope next update trying to fix itI'm interested but keeps showing the same stuff, which makes me leave the app after about a minute and it's very annoying 🤷🏻You could have added an option on Instagram to post a thread instead of copying an entire app to introduce one small option.There was no need of a new Twitter like app, instead Meta could've integrated the features of Twitter in Instagram itself just like they did for features copied from Snapchat, Pinterest, Discord, Tiktok etc 🙂There's an error when searching and in the following tab. The threads also cannot be translated.The text is not large when viewing a single thread. Also, when I want to exit Threads, I wish to keep my Instagram account.Meta team you just provide one platform to login just Instagram what can i do if i didn't want to sign up through Instagram there will be other options like sign in through Google account Facebook etc.Not bad so far, the only thing I had an issue with is you can't have more than one account right now. But I do love it so far not terrible. Credits go to meta for this one.Some of us do not want to use Instagram. Why is it necessary to access Threads via Instagram? Why there is no alternative registration/login without Instagram?Can I send messages to people? I don't want the Instagram app, I want THREADS and it seems to be missing that option.It's just fun and easy to use compared . personally it helps have some feed for my Instagram so yay threads I would encourage anyone to download thisno translation option and no chats. Please add these features .a lot of blue check accs in the home that are not in my interests .amazing!! twitter would be cry. btw pls make a new feature.. like download media, dark mode, views count, tab following and explore, trendings/topics and hastags.Give me translator man! Our community in Instagram is beyond borders.... Now we are having trouble to understand what our followers say! This is an emergency need 🦺 Overall, an amazing app 👍Unable to receive notifications of followed people's posts as I do with Twitter! Even with turning all app notifications on and pressing the BELL botton of each profile I follow!The app is soo bad don't install it because if u install it and then u wanna to remove ur account or the app you will remove the instagram too automatically so if you install it you can't remove it and twitter>>>>>Have some issues when searching people... Need more accessibility and as a start it's ok but need more user friendly option welcome u 1st கு appI'm unable to upload any photos, app keeps on crashing, I'm using z fold 4 latest OS available.. 😞crashed at least 30 times, every time I try to upload a picture it stops.App has been crashing everytime I scrolled past a certain thread. It's weird.I absolutely love the Threads app It’s a great way to stay connected with my close friends and share ideas and trends through textFails to upload so often. Can't easily search topics. Hopefully thus is due to the crazy uptake and it improves soonWhat's the point of launching it as a mobile-only app? Stealing data? Lack of a proper web app is a major turn off for me.The app worked well when I installed it. Now it's closing itself everytime I try to view replies to a thread.The app is good and all but I can't seem to post a new thread, anytime I try I get this notification \"your thread failed to upload \" please fix it for meI'm giving 3 stars for now, it will go up if features like DM's, a better search feature, filters for what i want to see on my feed etc get addedAmazing app overall, but still is missing some important additons, for example, a feed for only followers/topics/better search...Please introduce data saving. This app uses way too much data just for tweets. I don't need videos to load or high quality imagesDefinitely new. Fairly limited, but similar to Twitter and I'm sure more features will come over time.This Initial Version Is full Of Bugs .Please Fix as Soon As possible. Thanks For This App My Dear Instagram Team... Thank you Instagram TeamI started by searching “Threads” in the app store, scrolled through some small apps unfortunately also named Threads (RIP to those, inevitably), and clicked on Threads by Meta. The app asked me to connect my Instagram account to sign up, and I switched over from my personal to my professional page – sorry, readers, I will not be revealing my finsta here. Et voilà, I became a Threads user.The images and clips are not working to save on gallery So that would be great to download it to the deviceLove the interface, but can't get audio to work on videos using Android.Worst app I have ever seen..when i open this application it shows the multiple errors..many glitches in this application.. don't download itThe app is gorgeous, but I cannot have dual accounts like instagram that I can transfer between them easily.Needs a following-only home page or a better home suggestion algorithm. Maybe it just hasn't learned what content I like.So far so good. Seems like Twitter but, i think it's better, especially when Twitter forced its users to pay for twitter blue.5 star +😩, this app is so damn good, just some few touches like editing pictures before posting need to be added.The first few days it worked well until today. The app keeps shutting down & fails to open. DisappointedThis app has been amazing so far, Amazing UI, Good User Experience and absolutely seamless to use! Hoping that this will be a boon for upcoming creators!Getting \"Sorry something went wrong. Try again.\" error on all tabs except the post tab(works fine).App has huge bugs.. whom i don't even know or don't follow they post is coming to my feed and its irritating. Kindly fix this.Doesn't load photos. Closes abruptly. App. needs to be addressed asap as an update.Well, it's one of the new best apps that you can share your expression on, but still needs so many features.Disappointing. People flood it with photos and videos anyway. I wish it was just text based. This isn't a text based social network. It's just another social network.I am giving it 3 star because there is no hashtag trend. Neither live streaming option. And comparing to Twitter it's need more features to go ahead.The truth is that it is very good and has a very good design, but when I try to publish a thread with a photo, it takes me out and tells me that the app is not workingI can't see replays on any posts and activity tab is also unavailable. I just see the message \"Sorry, something went wrong. Try Again\"Something is very wrong. I get just screens of tiny symbols and the occasional video post? So bizarre.I'd be happy to help you with feedback on captions! Please provide me with the captions you'd like me to review, and I'll do my best to assist you.Great kick off expect experience and features will continue to improve best part no ads (yet) and highly engaged community.Way to go! But can you include a feature where you can create Groups for things that interests you so that interested people can join and be a member. Also, can you give us dark mode?App doesn't work. Enter username and password and get \"something went wrong, please try again\". Can't do anything or see anything other than this message.Because Threads is part of Instagram, it shares the same TOS. This means that nudity is banned, which makes me happy. I had enough of all of the porn bots on Twitter, so Threads was the smartest option. I love just how much better this app is over Twitter.I don't see any feature that will attract me to stay. Clearly they are trying to copy twitter but without success.The app is not fully optimised, if you go to upload a photo or video then it will crashed.Can not use the app. All texts overlap each other; can't read anything. Please fix it.Nice app like Twitter but with better ui and ux and the reason for 4 stars was please add switch account option I can't log out log in every time I want to switch.Only algorithmic feed, no chronological. Feed shows accounts that are not followed. Garbage app. Dead on arrival.Can't create the account. Instagram account setup doesn't work from Android phone. Bad initial experience.I am not getting any new posts while on home icon. My feed has the same posts that he had about a week ago with nothing new added.I wasnt getting notifications for my messages, I turned off this app and I started to get audio notifications...Apps not 100% works...sometimes apps crashed and ao many bugs...but i dont mind actually...hope mods can fix this asapSo far the app is good. I'm loving it. So addictig. But I request, put some \"see translation\" like what you did on Instagram. :))i honestly think this can beat twitter, that app have become the worst. i fully understand the concept of this one. keep it up!No translate function just like in ig or twitter that is very inconvenient. Hope can add this function very soon.Good app but few features lack like automated bot, ai bots and also hastags there should be an extra tab for discover. Thanks btw.I wish there was an easier way to switch between accounts (like we do in instagram) vs having to log in and out.Threads desperately in need of updates. Meta constantly updating FB while, at the same time, telling Threads users to be patient.Def needs more color. Plain white reminds me of isolation room. 😐And can you allow editing of posts, please. 😔Got app but it kept closing and refused me to set up an account no mater what I tried the app flagged me and that made no sense! I found another way and off I was made one post will wait and see if it gets noticed. As far as Facebook I don't use it much but probably more than I with threads will wait and see if they actually flag me for my one post ? Surprise surprise I finally decided to do a thread post and bam it never posted I didn't like Facebook much hate Twitter being run by Elon Musk.Where is the dark mode? How could you miss something like this while making the app? OMG, I can't. My eyes are hurting from the light mode.Best of Meta's app! Amazing experience so far with it. And better, than Twitter in UI/UX consistency!I like it but i think it needs a little more to it. Im not going to uninstall it i believe this app like instagram and facebook could do really goodits a good app so far, but i've some serious issue, is it my phone or the app idk, the app keep closing when i want to post more than one photo in one threadWhen this app is launched Within the 2 hours I have downloaded it, It's amazing and one of most beautiful thing which I likes more is that it can link with Instagram both are good aaps Thanks Mark Zuckerberg 😊Hi Meta Team, Threads app is very good. Its very easy to use and understand. But here i'm not able to use # tags. Could you pls add this features?? So we will be use #Tags in the our post.I'm not a fan of Instagram. I have to sign in with Instagram? Maybe their should be a Facebook option.Worst app, I can't delete my account, the only way is deleting my Instagram account. Please take a step and solve this kind of ugly problem!!! WORST APPLICATION!I'm very disappointed about this app. It's not working good, Everything seems ghosting. Contents are overlappingwas enjoying, thought great an app that will replace my large Twitter one that I stopped going on because of the bs. then 1 week into it, I get suspended with no explanation other than I have violated content rules( I had not yet posted anything, only reposted) and to appeal or even open app I must enter a code sent to my phone # only it never comes. So I guess I won't be on threadsThis is so friendly interface and easy to post our opinions.But we need extra features for example pinning...It's very nice love the interface I just have one complaint and it's for the home feed To be more of people we're following, seeing a lot of random threads other than this it's AmazingWon't let me create an account. I don't want to be on Instagram. If this is a Twitter replacement just let me sign up to it!its pretty creative but it's crashing!! ill still give it a five stars and ill update my review along the way if necessaryThe app GUI is crashing, cant use it. Needs improvement, device specific updates n bugfixes.Terrible doesn't even work properly and I don't like the regional segregation. Just bad copy of another bad social media app.Am the first to write a review on Mark Zuckerberg new app...wow😂😂 I had early access to it in the last few day and I think its great. When u open it u prompt to login with Instagram You keep ur same user name and you can follow the people you are already following on Instagram if u wish....or u can recreat if u wish. U can add a bio automatically import from ig... At a very first glance it feels familiar They not inventing the wheel here. The design is minimum it clean and attractive𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘀 doesn't work on my phone. It's shaky and unstable. Hardly can I see anything without blurring.Simple ui and great in-app experience.. Loved it❤️.. It would be nice if next update includes: Data saving Mode, DM, trending, Hashtags...Good, but it would be nice if there was a save feature so I can save a post if I want and I don't want to see posts in my feed of people or organizations I don't followI understand it's connected to Instagram, but being a text based app, shouldn't it have messaging features as well?I like the community this app has and it's really fun to use. Just find a way to get rid of all the bots and scammers, it's a real problemNo option to see only the people you are following in your threads, lots of random people and groups showing instead.The app screen doesn't update and gets all clogged up, completely unusable.Terrible! I scroll and all text and images leave trails and it just stuck there!Seems very smooth, so far I don't see any bugs! Already working better than Twitter.This app will never take over Twitter until you're allowed to view posts in chronological order. Twitter is a news hub for most based off of what they're into. Who wants to hear about a player getting traded 3 days later when it instantly shows on Twitter?please add polls/edit text, also improve the algorithm, i followed many people but i still get so many random threads that don't match my interest or anything from random peopleIt's crashing every 5 mins i use it. Quite annoying. Edit-- now it's not even starting I am using nothing phone1It's worse than Facebook. Only random posts in the feed, nothing relevant. Plus I don't see posts of the accounts I follow. Waste of timeNot straight forward. Not clear where one post or thread starts and whee it ends. Very simple background. Needs workThe seamless integrations between Threads and Instagram was such a smart move. Creators would be WAY less motivated to.A) we need a character count B) we need hashtags to actually work C) we need to be able to pin a post to the top of our profile. D) we need to be able to save media. Everyone shares and saves media. Wtheck. E) also we can't mute accounts? Sorry but I don't wanna block every single person out there. I use this for one thing and one thing only. And because it's new there are THOUSANDS of ppl idk showing up on my feed. Sorry but this won't ever replace twitter. 🤣🤣Login / registration fails. 2FA Codes are never sent via email or sms. I tried for 40 minutes. Dreadful first run experience.Urgently needs a button to switch between accounts, it's a real pain to log in/out every time !Required to have Instagram account as well? BS.... regardless if from I-Gram, should'nt be required to have an additional bloatware app.Yeah this app is kinda of wonky on my device... Theres an issue with the graphics when i scroll or change tabs kinda like runny ink or smudging of the penIt's a copy. Should have its own interface and features . Something new should have been introduced!The aap is although very good.... But the refreshment takes a long time... And overall experience is good enough.Better than Twitter 😀. It took me a while to find the app because there is a different app called Threads. I suggest you add a link on Instagram for downloading this app...The UI is nice and smooth. Like the integration with InstagramI only want to see the threads from people I follow and not people I don't know. Videos automatically playing and I can't turn them off.This isn't working properply... The screen is dragging all way down and content is overlapping tooo... Someone needs to fix thisI think it's a great app. I think the best thing about it is that there's no direct messaging and at least right now no ads. Right now give it a try. I think you will be happy with it.Love it! It's like old school Twitter which I love. Everyone is happy and having fun. And where I know that won't last forever ...it's just so nice. We needed this!After installing this app my Instagram and thread both have stopped and not working. Not even showing log in page.I liked this app. This app interface is relexable. Like trending option comes on twitter same trending option should also come in thisShortly:Twitter better, more specific:small user base, app crashes quiet frequently, interface is too simpleSeamless. But it's having an error right now. Maybe the birds are flocking over here.GREAT APP!!! DEFINITELY AN UPGRADE FROM DYING TWITTER. NEGATIVE COMMENTS WILL COME BASED ON ZUCK AND ELON DIFFERENCES, ATTACK CAMPAIGNS, BUT NOT THE APP PROBLEM.Bad functionality and lacking features. Can't choose who I want to see. Poor knockoff of twitter.Meh, it's just a bootleg twitter. There is nothing special and too many brands showing up on my feed. I'm going to stick with Twitter for now.I can Easily share posts , videos, and Ideas, Outstanding app. But Minor Changement UI . And People Accounts. Add more Functional ThingsApplication is not working on Redmi Note 5 pro . When we open likes page it occurs that home page is glitched to like page .Need to fix it.I want to like it. But it only let me posts pics for one day before going back to crashing every time I try....Stop showing me pages I don't follow. I don't follow them because I don't want to see them. Also.... Chronological order please. We all HATE your trash algorithm. 0/5 so far. Fix it.Most disgusting app. Twitter is far far better than this app. Wasted my time! It's just a text version of Instagram.The app is lagging each time I scroll it's blurs I can barely see.... Different post on each other. Pls this has to be changedthreads is horrible 😭 I can't see anything, all the letters r mixing up I can't see a single world. Whenever I open this app it acts weirdly, like so crazyyy!! So messyNeed more feature such as search by words, hashtags, an actual working top/latest search, etc then this app will be even more perfectI make a better app name of this : E passport Online. This app w Help you to make or create passport. Also you wll get passport so fast. Thank you.it would be better if only the people you follow appear in your feed, and a translation option wouldn't hurtAfter 1 day use the app seems to be perfect and smooth like insta and watsapp. I think it will be a better version of Twitter 😜.It's a great up,but I would recommend to add the dark theme as it makes a beautiful view when using the app as it's in InstagramGive some editing options. Like crop image, filters etc... And option to edit Threads. Otherwise its FUn.Really nice apps, it's free service will skyrocket in popularity, I urge you to update the system constantly to make it better, and best of luck..!🙂❤️Unlike Twitter , UI is very good and no clutter. Basic and easy functionalitiesIt's cool, i mean, it just started so it could improve a little more like adding DMs, hashtags and the follow request for public accounts💥Exceptional, this app would be far better than Twitter in coming years and for the fact that it's synced to Instagram is awesomeSo.. it looks good for now.. I do have one suggestion.. we need a translation button for us fans who are following international idols and actors.. so just 4 stars for nowDon't like the scrolling. It still lacks features. User can't explore communities easily yet.Just wonderful. Except the suggestions. They should tailor feeds to language preferences.The app is nice but please we need a poll feature.a pin to profile feature and a direct message feature that's all.I am try login to this app but all time error show . I am unable to login in any way for these three days. Please solve this issue.Needs quick switch between accounts, feed from people you actually follow and of course the ability to delete the account.Nice interface and user experience Perfect substitute for twitter, Kindly work on thread translation.I love this app, way fewer spam bots than most, great community. Needs a few more features and that's it.Everytime I try to make a post with a picture the app crashes, sorry but I can't rate it any higherThe app has been amazing since the first day. 😍 and the people who said it crashes 0r overlaps threads and stuff are the hater'sThis Social Media, is photograpy friendly... I really recommend it, the algorithm is unique and friendly..I miss twitter. I don't like the data sharing and all that zukeeberg does. I wish my Instagram account was not linked to threads. I'm disgusted! How can people be so horrible 🤮Good We would like to add clips of the reals and more features and means of trend such as Twitter It is rather excellentlike the design, maybe give us some recommendation of account in our interest, somekind like explore in instagram so the feeds can be a bit more interesting to scroll 🤔My threads app is glitched. It is not working at all. I hope Instagram team will fix this problem soon.Hashtags aren't working and there's a limit to the people you can follow and like. It also needs some sort of explore or trending tabI just downloaded the app and I want to upload pictures it's showing error that I need to download the newest version 😕 so annoyingIts a perfect glitch app, i tried to reinstall but same problem. Just when i scroll down it starts glitching!I can't get rid of posts from people I Do Not Follow hoarding my page and I cannot put things in chronological order. Also this app just kindof sucks. I'm not using thisAstounding app! Everything is so easy to use and is in one place. Keep the great work going!so there is a bug in my device idk what happened like multiply the text and the other all off my phone ( Sony Xperia Xz1 Compact ), where i can contact the admin so i can send a screenshot or record what happened here...It's just ok. It definitely isn't Twitter. No hashtags and bio character length isn't as long as Twitter. Feels like a beta version.It may change the ecosystem of Twitter but will take some time.It's fun and enjoyable again we will waste some time.No organization. I cant find the accounts i follow. You know what this app reminds me of.....oh yea, TWITTER!! You are not ready. Pull the plug and go back to the drawing board.The UI completely glitches out moments after the app is opened. Unusable.I cant see what I'm typing. The keyboard comes up and the text bar thing is under the keyboard. So annoying.It still lacks lots of features but there's hope for the future. I appreciate the competition it brings to the table.Been great so far! However I can't seem to reinstate hidden badges on Instagram...is there a way to toggle this function?Everything on the app gets hazy after i enter into it. I cant even see anything. It perfectly installed bt doesnt workThe email account I used for my threads account can't open the app again and also since I opened the threads account my Instagram has not been responding like how it used to beWon't let me log in, error sending video identification (I have fiber) despite inputting my 2pa. Day 2: no email reset for access to my accountIt's really very amazing... It's a new app so yaa it does require some improvements but it's good overall... Keep improving.Love the experience so far, add dark mode and a way to save posts to view later.UI breaking all times and leads to infinite UI changes like old windows dragging functionalityNot perfect, but a lot of promise for the future especially compared with the brain dead bird appFor me the app is buggy and the attach button where I want to post an image or a video is invisible (although still there)Just added one feature of tweet on Instagram app and made a new app Why should I use another app when I can get all the features on Instagram I think this should have been the feature upgrade on Instagram rather than new appUrdu is a very widespread language which is written, read and spoken all over the world. 1. You should add Urdu language support for South Asia region. 2. Kindly add increase font size option in threads's settings. I hope my point will be considered.My first day on this app but its already entertaining,but it needs more features like darkmode,polls,inbox and something similar to spaces ,thanks for this appmy app is crashing, always shaging when i try to scroll the app, i think it is a bug. will change my rating when already fixedDo not download this app. If you delete this app after creating an account then your Instagram account will also be permanently deleted..I've given 5 🌟 for a 30 minutes, find out the app keeps on stopping when png images uploaded. But now 4 🌟 until it's resolved.Your app is good, almost perfect. We aldo need a place to chat with our followers like Instagram. Please we need it. Thanks ZukkySo far so good... I just hope that the save photo feature will be included soon and also hope that it won't get toxic lolAmazingly beautifu and user friendly app, just jumpt in hope there are no bumps ahead and it's gonna be a smooth ride.Would give a 5 just cus its a good alternative to Twitter but waiting for them to add a trending tab, DMs, bookmarks and to be able to view my likes!Why Meta why? We already had Twitter. This is another redundant app. Facebook trynna literally copy each & everything from its competitors. Needless to say, the absurd logo looks like some kind of pubic hairs seen in WCsAll the texts get mixed up and I can't read. I can't use the app at all. It needs more development.Being a Software Engineer, I felt this is very interesting but it still need more improvements and also need to make better from user side.Needs a following tab, the feed algorithm is hot garbage. Every time I open the app I'm assaulted by 20-30 posts of pure cringe before I see a single thread from someone I actually follow.Perfect 👍 Only one thing that is left is Just add the trending feature and that’s it ,it would be the end of Twitter 🙌Booted it up twice, both times it asked me to turn notifications on. Yeah, nah.Very bad app i just download it and login on it but after that it start laging at massive level there is nothing to see properly on screen worst app i see in my life🤬Great start to a social platform. Only issue is the home feed is clogged with celebs and brands trying to gain traction by spamming posts. Hopefully this gets resolved soonWhy anyone would give this more than one star given how bad it is? And I don't care if it's just \"starting out.\" They had a chance to make this good at launch, KNOWING their competition at twitter, take the good parts from twitter and IMPROVE on it. But they didn't. Also considering this is owned by FB/Instagram, I'm not expecting this to get any better. Already bad enough I see posts from people THAT I DON'T FOLLOW, instead of the people I DO follow. So much for a \"twitter killer.\"The compulsory link to Instagram, which is linked to Facebook. Well makes unusable to those who don't want to be part of every part of metas empireMy account gets automatically logged out of Instagram when I sign in for threads nd vice versa, it gets logged out of threads when I use Instagram. How to fix?The app is cool But I couldn't access my photo folders It's a newly launched app, so there's still room for improvementToo much, noise still primitive, can't filter my front page, .....for a multi billion dollar company, u can do better.Great app, but I had issue posting on my wall. The app closes as soon as I picked a file to upload. Any suggestions?Can't upload any photos. It says failed to upload. I thought this was an Instagram app? Can't upload photos?Full of bugss as soon i open the app the screen starts to stutter how can u release a app that is not even in proper state of workingSeems like it is blend of several social media platforms but there are many things missing but aap is doing good.This app is terrible. Nothing works correctly, even on a S23 Ultra. Very useless. Not enjoyable whatsoever.The app has a cool UI 💯..I would suggest you add a feature that enables users to crop photos before postingthe app is good but there are many options and updates we needed like chat option , trending threads , report account , there should be no vulgar videos etcIt's not working properly. When I try to scroll it starts glitching and I can't see anything.I loved this app so much but iam having one problem and this problem is that the app doesn't have dark mode in the settings like instgramIt is working well as expected. I hope features that are missing will be added like DMs.Its exceptional though it lacks a DM section. And it could really use a for you and following selector to differentiate threadsI wish the \"followers\" were sorted according to the Time they were followed. It's just sorted randomly, making it crazy scatteredPlease I can't go dark mode in the app even though I use dark mode on Instagram, hope you fix this.(android user) Also put pinned post and photo section to desiminate thingsIt just looks like Twitter but not as expensive provided there but it's a beginning, I hope for better.Accidentally deleted my thread batch from Instagram and there's no way to get it back pls update and add a feature to add back.I now installed and logged in but there is a bug inside the app looks the screen not stable and the writing shakes. So can't control it.App is very good.It is blasting the bug and not even allowing me to open my lover page and what not.I cant see the excellent app like this till now.Itbuas everything.I am uninstalling everything now for this app.😁I am enjoying the app so far, but I would like an option to share Instagram posts and start a thread with them.Clean and sleek user interface. Easy to read and fast.The screen look shaky once you start scrolling can't even see anything properly. The worstI love that the team is working hard to keep propaganda and other nonsense off of the platform!just installed it, it glitches really bad for some reason when i barely do anything. i can't access anything. please fix.The experience is good so far ...!!! Hope we get editing option on the post .threads in my phone not works, if i scroll or move to the menu on the bottom the pictures and inscription are roll up, please help ?My connected Instagram account is crashing every minute. Absolutely frustrating.Great so far but video volume is not working...its silent. And please add an edit button! ♡I can't see the POST button when I type past my keyboard, even though I haven't exceeded the word or character limit.The Scrolling is not smooth like other Meta Apps. I have to push the content up hard. Please fix this.Enjoyed it the first day, but now I can't even open the app. It keeps crashing whenever I open it.Content on home is garbage. I need somewhere to see trending topics and things like that for this to be useful.Please try to upgrade this app I can see that you can't send private message to someone which very wrong how can a social media platforms especially like this no place of private message check even Twitter has place of private messageThe app itself it's awesome..but need improvement a little bit.. more features must be included also!It's buggy rn. Please update. I can't scroll, the screens are laid on top of one anotherThere's still a lot of potential left unexplored. So much! First, fix the bugs!Okay so the first few hours were fine and I was posting my threads non stop and having fun and gained a follower. But then a after that when I opened the app again it deleted all my THREADS and said \" Sorry, something went wrong. Try again\" and I had no followers , couldn't see my threads because they got deleted and I couldn't see posts on my feed. Very disappointed 😞Full of bugs, followers count stuck, can't see others followers, can't see who's not following you, can't complete delete others mention on your thread, Instagram quick access disappeared...There is no translation option in thread for that reason most of the user can't translate foreign language into english. Mark Zuckerberg please set language translation program in your new threads app.1 - we can't delete our account in this without deleting out insta account 2 - Even after removing the number badge on my insta profile several times, it keeps coming back.Everything is fine but sometime may raise the issues. Glitch happened in my device, i should to upload the photos of glitchI love it already. Simple to use. I think you guys should work on the display names and usernames so we can be able to change the display name anytime we want. Thank you.The worst thing about this application is that it is connected to the Instagram account, and this is not a good thing, because you will not be able to delete the account until you delete the Instagram account, and this is bad, but very bad, even worse.Edit : Thanks for fixing the bug. But pls make a website or a desktop app.I think it'll be better if another update for threadsapp would enable you share a video posted on threads to Instagram story while it's playing and not a static pic of the video as it is nowBest app like Twitter but when need update about scroll button when you write long paragraphs yuo cant scroll up and down & you can't Edit pictures please fix it 🖐️As soon as I opened the app It got registered to my insta account is all good then once opened its having a blurry page wana change that issue pleaseAdd some tabs like trending page , like and thread count, topics,lists like other things of tweeter and it will overtake tweeter easily.I don't use Instagram, and this app only allows Instagram users to sign in. But I just don't want to create an Instagram account to use threads. 😕Don't Download. After installing Threads and sync with Instagram, Instagram keep crashing and not opening.Intial release is fine. It's has to improve in editing option to everyone like an insta post.the design is absolutely class, it looks really clean, smooth, keep up the good work MetaThis is a good app and it can be able to replace twitter in future 💥. But is has few bugs on it also but regarding this this is a amazing aapapp is not working properly on my phone, it glitches extremely madly and it doesnʼt let me swipe down without glitching.I'm facing glitch in this app. The screen feels jittery and unable to scroll. Giving this 1 🌟 , might change this in the futureAfter 6 days use, it's not good so far. After all that noise, Twitter still better.Something wrong with this app....kindly fix it. I can't use it nicely. Seems have a virus inside on this app....The app is behaving wierd. It looks like there is a glitch. The scree is shaking and nothing is working.Old phone not compatible even if play store said it was compatible on my device, when i scroll it looks like counter strike sky box when you fly out of boundFeels like an older version of Twitter. Threads on the public feed are somewhat facile. Waiting for more integrations before updating this review.I'm not satisfy this app because this app blur on my phone screen can you solve this problem because I see this problem in every time in phone I can't understand what can I do on this situationI like the app. But there is something wrong when I am uploading a pictures. It keeps crashing 🥲🥲So many lacking features that need to be integrated. Even I updated the app already it's still lagging.Frustrating! I don't have, and don't want, an Instagram account, so I can't use the App...If I don't have / want an Instagram account so I can't login, that's not acceptable. I am uninstalling the app.I think it's a great idea that thread has no DM. If it could be kept that way! Besides thie app is cool like that.I cannot post photos with videos and cannot post single video or reply with videos. Always failed, please fix ASAPFair- Everytime trying to start a \"thread\" and when I try post or add a photo it kicks me out completely.Seems like a good start. Hoping to see more improvements. Overall, solid experienceI really don't see the point in this app. Also, I really don't like how you can't delete your Threads account without deleting your Instagram..Unable to use without Instagram. I don't like Instagram, so I guess I have to go away, and install Twitter instead.Although everything is fine but please add the feature of switching accounts in @Threads, an Instagram app, too like that in InstagramGuys, this app keeps glitching, META fix this ASAP, cuz the app has great potential and an amazing UI, so please work on it.HORRIBLE buggy bad wannabe twitter. Drains battery bug. Heats up all devices. Interferes with wifi and mobile network settings. Ignores permission denials. Breaks privacy apps settings. This should be banned and illegal. Horrible. Google play should be ashamed.So far I love it..clean interface, 5 minute videos, 500 character limit, import your Instagram details with a few clicks, follow your Instagram followers with one click, the ability to post to mastadom coming..I think Twitter is dead and zuckerberg and Meta have a winner 🏆So far this app is amazing as a new bie sweet and smooth.. hashtags only seems not to be functioning yet.Don't know what's up with the app, when I try replying to someone's thread with a pic. The app just automatically closes.??It does not work in dark mode of android.screen overlapping each other .fix this glitch ASAP.I can't upload photos I have no idea why. Please do fix this bug for me so I have more reasons to stay in this appMain problem with threads is its feeds... It doesn't show from people u follow...kindly allow to show feeds only from people we follow..no translation for different languagesA lot better than Twitter. Runs a lot more smoothly and you don't get the random nudity which is A LOT better.It should be linked together with IG so we can jump from Thread to Instagram without closing any app to log on another app.Slow and stopped responding. But moreover just boring. And I don't need Facebook tracking yet another thing about me.Shows posts from random popular pages I'm not interested in instead of posts for the pages I follow!! Please fix this asap!!Useless app can't even see single word on screen due to glitch.everything is overlap on each other.It has glitches on my phone and i have not yet been able to make it work. Overall experience so far 3/10This app just seems like the lite version of Twitter after the collab with Instagram. Could have been better.I really like this application because his interface is really impressed me , this app is very smooth and easy to useCan we fix the scrolling on the activity screen? I cant scroll down! Other than that, looks pretty cool.Those having issues, have issues everywhere else in life. App works fine just as intended.I dunno what happened but can you bring back my account?? like fr my threads suddenly got disabled and now even my Instagram account was disabled.. seriously I shouldn't have downloaded this app if I know what's gonna happenI hope there'll be options on switching from your followers (friends) posts versus the pages or public figure you follow so that the Home will not be too overcrowded.I am not downloading this new app. Unless Facebook gives its creators the opportunity to live chat with the administration in any problem. YouTube gives all opportunities to its creators but Facebook doesn't and bans them immediatelyThe app is phenomenal! Everyone's just so positive. Can't wait to see how it will turn out. Would love to have a translate button on it.While scrolling the page all the pages are ovearloaded I can't use the app properly it makes bad impression on the appYou can't see the text input window when replying. It is covered by the keyboard making it so you can't see what you are typing.It is great app since it is not complicated and easy to use without any unnecessary options that hinders your undeniable experience from this app.Best Experience so far on social media!! Pls help me on this one. When I post a video, I don't get any audio on it. Pls helpCan't post any pictures. Why can some people post photos but I can't? Definitely reflecting my rating of this app!I'm really impressed with Threads. It's a great new social media app that I highly recommend.Installed this on day first of its launch. This app is undoubtedly good but needs a lot of improvements yet. Keep it up.A combination of ig and twitter nice but need translations for every language for better interactions.I wish we couldn't save pictures and videos...use Instagram colors on the repost sign to show a repost was done ...also add trending topics somewhereCrashes when uploading a picture so what's the point in the app. Shouldn't of rushed getting it outaccounts i don't follow are showing up instead of people i do follow, the only way to see their posts is to go to their account. fix the app and I'll change my review but i am not happy otherwise.As social media aps go, this is awful. You would expect better with all of the trial an error our civilization has had over the last 20 years.App is full of Bug and glitch Not optimised at all Specifically when phone is set to dark modeUntil now I have not faced any problems regarding its usage and good thing is that it doesn't contain any type of ads on it.There are many things missing in this app: 1. Trends 2. Search for tweets 3. Direct massage 4. Save option for photosI will change my rate when: 1- Dark mode works on my app 2- when I only see people I follow in my wall and 3- when I can search for posts instead of only profilesToo early to say but I like the interface. A bit slow though. Will share more in coming days. Follow @baloch_travelogueit has great potential, needs a few big fixes still and I'm begging for a following tab/page.Yo the app doesn't work for days now. Tried re-installing. Everything keeps pasting on top of each otherI like that it doesn't show like count but number of replies. Social Media is about community, not popularity. Good job Instagram and Meta!I know this will get added soon because the app is still new, but having an option to translate threads would be helpful!Installed and immediately deleted it. App full of bugs. Cheap copy of Twitter. Don't even try this garbage 🤮I think Threads need a massage option to connect with others easily. Thank you.annoying glitch every time I am typing something, the app would suddenly closed and everything I just typed would be gone.I had Awesome Experience using, User Interface is simple, No Fake Accounts, Bots Trolls etc.. like on Twitter hope this app will Replace Twitter and Be A Better Alternative.App has way too many phone permissions. No way to turn off or delete without removing Instagram.Buggy on redmi 8, the display is overlapping when i change the tab, same case when i scroll it.App crashes every time I try to attach a photo! I know the app is new so thats why 3 stars instead of 1 😩Not good. You just doing copy paste of Twitter layout. do something new if you have otherwise don't waste your time and money.Lots of potential here, but it's a bit bare right now in features. I hope you make a separate tab for who you follow.Needs work on not logging you out of instagram and vice versa, cos of the constant switching I'm now locked out of instagram and can't log back inTooo much glitch at one time. Even I can't use this app when I login and open this app my screen just glitching just fix this issueSir it's good but in my phone sir always happening crash problem sir whenever I am opening my threads app always crash happens plz 🙏 solve this problem sir as soon as possible...Never thought I would be installing a meta app on my phone but the fumes coming off the cesspool at the original \"internet town square\" is becoming too much.I loved this new, Elmo-free social media app until yesterday 13 July, when it started crashing every time I open it.The experience was not good. It is just second copy of Twitter..it was not expected that u have a app like insta still u are copying others..very dissapointing qStill a lot of improvements to make. But it's looking fast with great UX so far.#Threads not a copy of #Twitter it's different from Twitter their is more option than Twitter 500 letter option is on threads and even at a time we can upload 10 photography it's looking good and on 8 to 9 hours it's followers has reached on top of any social media great to have threads Thanks a lot to the whole team of threads and also to Mark Zuckerberg thanks a lot for give world such a beautiful social media apps #ThreadsVery bad experience having till now . Not able to scroll the window it's lagg a lot , please go further and help me outCurrently unusable, everytime I open threads and scroll up and down, the UIs and Texts keeps multiplying like India's population rateWell too Simple to use, yet reponse is good. Glad to know, one of few countries, we are experiencing it now!It's not working in Android. When I scroll , display will vibrating. Please fix it as possible as.Basically Facebook with a different UI. Let's see how long til bots take over this one too.Very well built. It is generally amazing for a new social media platform. The community is nice and it's generally relaxingI hope the security on this app will not be like that of Instagram, easily hacked. Else we will still go back to twitter.I like the Picture carousel Make all video ratio to be 1:1 if I like it I will click to view, videos click should push me the reel rabbit hole, just show metrics on replies likes or reposts.It's really a nice app. Same features as Twitter. It's very interesting and easy to use3rd day. Suddenly the option ( a good one) to share any thread to insta feed disappears! Not fair. Bring it back asap..No hashtags so you can't search up what you like & it only works on your phone. Mastodon is superior.No dark mode, no cronological order mode, no desktop version, no only followers mode, probably the worse meta app yet, worse than facebook.Unless they add a feature to only see threads by those who you follow, or threads they interact with, this app is basically useless.scrolling is so messed up that the screen becomes unviewable!! why release an app before full testing just to compete with twitter!!!More features : like a listening to.., maybe voice note, keep no DM, no Following to count, an edit threads, a translator, no ads pleaseMaybe because the app is new, but it kept on crashing/closing on its own whenever i want to post a pictureDefinitely pushing an agenda. Very biased and boring. Hoping it gets better.This app is amazing! I feel it's gon get wayyy better!!! Can't wait for more updates n new features to this app! I'm definitely giving 5 star (day 2 of using).Perfect timing for a text based social app to launch in the rise of AI trained on natural language, but, bye bye privacy.When I open it on my phone it's like it has a virus or something .. I cant type nor do anything without the screen looking like it's rubbing everything 😔U shud add some interesting features in this app which no other app have....jus like liking pic showers hearts n some other kind of interesting stuff....The app needs more work. It constantly fails to upload upload and barely shows most of my posts and comments.Loved this new initiative by Instagram the app features are easy to use and the interface is lovable ♥️Useless app, since day 1 this app just stuck, I can't even use it properly.. after clear cache this app still glitching..Ngl, this app is better than any other social Media apps, u can get access easily, and it's very easy to use. I really liked it 😍Great app. Better than Twitter. Neat, and smooth UI, plus media quality is also great.The only reason I'm giving it a three star is because when you follow people they don't show up on your feed it's a bunch of random users other than that the app itself is pretty coolHorrible algorithm for feed, shows just randomly anything. Makes no sense at all.Very barebones at the moment. It has lots of potential though, hopefully they don't screw it upEasy interface but it needs to be accessible by PC like Insta and FB are.Seems intresting but my feed has too many glitches it says it supports A9 but alphabets in my feed is overlapped overlayed can't read a thing.. 🙁Threads is the social media app I've been waiting for! It's a game-changer in terms of connecting and sharing with friends.So far, I like how it looks. I don't like that I see random people's posts on my timeline. I would prefer to see just the posts of the people I follow.Can't use it as I don't have an Instagram account. Not interested in Instagram so I'll just stick with Facebook.It was OK I like the app but has started to crash and it says it has a bug and the developer needs to fix itThe app's concept is great, but it's full of glitches! Whenever the content in the display changes, the full app becomes glitchy. Even on a small scroll, the problem appears. Let alone some button clicking! Maybe the issue is only applicable for a few type of users. But, please fix the bug. In spite of this app's being great, I have to stay neutral by giving 2 stars is just because of these bugs.App won't send verification codes, the AI has also decided I'm trying to create a fake profile. FrustratingThis app is terrible. Why on earth I am supposed to see what lots of people, I am not following, are writing about? Also, why can't I create an account separate from my Instagram account?If Meta wanted to go head to head with Twitter, they should have given us a better quality app. Hidden words do not work and the home feed is nothing but the same threads all day. I'm still seeing the same threads from 6 days ago. Twitter is the superior app.The Ui is minimal, clean and aesthetically pleasing. Connecting your IG with this, like allowing the thread to be shared to stories so fluently is appealing I must say. Allow landscape mode for tablets and this thing is golden 👌🏼Translations are a dire need to have in this app since we all be connecting with overseas celebrities and people all around the world...Hii threads I'm having an issue with posting a photo help out. I think that the wide frame photos are not fitting in it Plz replyKicks me off everytime I post something. Considering how bad the Facebook feed has gotten over the last month it shouldn't be a surprise. At this point I'm wondering if they screwed Facebook up on purpose to send millions of set up Facebook users over to their other platform.All pages expect the main timeline now leads to \"Something went wrong, please try again\".The app is good but I'll give it 3 stars why because every time I scroll it glitches and stops working so please try to make it better for low devicesThe application keeps glitching since i open it, once i touch the screen it glitchs, can't use it at allEverytime i try to upload the photos apps keep crashing. Fix this. 👎 So iam giving only 3Thread will be hanged by thread. The app is smooth , and they have some good connection and sync with Instagram that helps to connect with world but it's privacy policy and data breach from user is very bad and u have to delete insta to delete threads. Twitter= twitter Threads= twitter+ Instagram. No free speech? The review will be neutral I love twitter by logo,name and it's popularity and free speech where it's broken in threads . Musk vs zuck. It's musk the winner 🏆 by twitter.This app is amazing after using it I thought of uninstalling twitter 😂...This is going to be even better than Twitter I have a feeling!! Thankyou Mark Zuckerberg Sir For this new Amazing Application - Threads !!Couldn't instal it on my desktop. Not an Instagram user so it was difficult to sign up taking an hour..Ok, so again algorithm is going to feed you with all sorts of garbage. Make the \"see people you follow only\" mode.Feed is flooded with random people I care nothing about, not seeing many posts from those I actually follow. Crashes anytime I try to post a photoLess informative and less engaging Twitter alternative. It's like Twitter except less of everything!Calm and somewhat colected, it is missing some key features like hashtags and polls...but its still new so we can let it off on that...thinking they will come in a couple weeksIt is a good app although I'd like it to have dark mode enabled because I like my settings in light mode and social media on dark modeYes i think it is better than Twitter it is fact it si a great deal better than TWITTER but there is one disadvantage you cant enter TREAD without Instagram account but i liked Threadupload a photo then crash, close app immediately, fix it soon, what app is that if like that, cannot upload a photoI don't have Instagram account. Unable to login with others social networks like Facebook... Finally uninstalled the app.it has a lot of glitches as it is in its very first stages and needed lot of improvements.To login it demands instagram account. It is conditional. If you have not an Instagram account you can't login in threads .Good interface. Need to set it up to be able to translate threads.Threads is a spin-off app from Instagram that focuses on conversations rather than visual content. You can log in with your Instagram account and share text updates and join public discussions. And the same is an app that messes with Twitter. Its owner is Mark Zuckerberg. ...THANK YOU...Not supporting on my mi readme note 5 pro lots of bug i can see....and content is overlays on each other beside open on another screen !!Didn't feel the need of the blue colored version of this same app but other than that everything looks greatI felt this app is yet another time waste, with no particular use case other than bringing down Twitter and does it provide a healthy competition to improve Twitter....hell noooCrashes a lot, time line is filled with accounts I don't follow, besides that it's an OK appIt's Just a another social media like Twitter, And some of the bugs were there and it still need some more features more than TwitterI will give the app 5 stars because the feels like Instagram but in a smoother way The interface looks very nice and coolI hope the thread can be automatically translated. I found it slightly difficult that i need to translate the thread using different appA little nitpick but my phone settings literally does not have a dark mode option. Please put it in the app, thanks.There is a glitch can't see full screen there isn't option to send screenshot so i would have sent it to show you guys.Lol doesnt even work. If your insta is linked you cant unfollow people on thread or you unfollow them on Instagram its kind dumb. Post wont send fail message everytime. So far not impressed.It's only Instagram but with less features. A downgrade, so to speak.Shows Threads from people & companies I don't follow and have no interest in. Despite changing settings, app doesn't just show me accounts I follow and want to see.It's a bit disapppointing when you tried to log in and it will ask you for your Instagram username and password. Where in when you log in with Instagram you used you Facebook credentials for it. Kinda confusing 😕This is such a pleasent surprise, couldn't have asked for more at this juncture, was worried and tired of juncks, and not having access to my thread. Meta is always my happy place for combination of reasons and I completely trust it's business ethics more than any provider's from the start until now, looking forward to connect threads.Worst app Twitter is better than threads and Twitter is better optimized its run smoothly on my device and on the other hand threads is lagging littlebit in my device copy paste is not the best solution and if you try to uninstall it your Instagram account gonna deactivate i cant even DM my crushI cancelled all pending requests and it's still sending requests fix this!!! Can I have a prize for telling this bug?I am one of first 100 peoples (77th actually) worldwide giving review to this app within 3 hrs of its launch. Really looking forward having a good time with this social media space.Total bs app. No concern for privacy ,just another attempt by meta to get our data. Would prefer Twitter anyday over it, it's just a leftist attempt to destroy twitterApp crashes after opening with blurry text and not smooth functioning.Needs Instagram acc to use. Instagram requires a real identity. I just want to read posts, not put my real identity out there for the world to useEven shorter vidios not getting uploaded. Very slow working. Need to go a very long way to compete with Tweeter.There is NO REASON this app needs my financial info, my search history, browsing history or sensitive info. Just another way for Mark Zuckerberg to get rich from violating every users privacy.This is actually a really good social media, but in Android I always got crash everytime I want to post a photoRecommendations: 1. Improve interface (Take inspiration from Twitter) 2. Make it more organized and distinctive 3. Add bookmarksAfter connect to instagram, it take too much time, app will stuck I'm trying to open app 3 to 4 times but app can't openThis app is so much better than the bird app. The feed pretty much shows everyone's posts. And this app is pretty fun.The algorithm is my main problem it really needs improvement, I've been interacting with lots of uninteresting postNeeds timeline improvement, hashtags/topics and a proper search function (not just finding users) in order to truly be viablePersonally, I prefer Twitter more than threads. It is exactly like replacing Google with Bard, but now there is not even a name of Bard.The only way to erase the data they've collected or delete the threads profile is by deleting your instagram account. I wish I had known this sooner.Great app! I've found many interesting people here. 👍 Please, add auto-translation. 😊I like the simplistic layout. Haptic feedback is nice too. Still too early to sayThread's🧵 user interface is really great. i like it very much, Thanks to Mark Zuckerberg and Meta. ❤Videos play no sound and when you click the unmute button the video just gets stuck. Very irritating bugwow! this is such an original, innovative, and creative idea, just like the stories on Instagram. I am so proud of the Instagram team for coming up with such a great idea. 5 stars 👍👍Crashing constantly everytime I tried to upload a picture. 1 star for now, will update once it's solvedI love the app and i think if you can add a translation section same as Instagram that will be greatly appreciatedI don't like the fact that your phone has to be on dark mode to active the app's dark mode.As there is no translation option, trying to copy the text will result with the app crashing.I don't know what's wrong with my thread but it keep glitching. Since the first day I've downloaded this app, I can't even use it.Loving it so far, looking forward to more features being added over time!All usernames are fetching from Instagram. It's not possible to claim your username. I could not create a profile. Rubbish.Garbage, so here we go... an app about threads, well at least on Twitter you can look at threads without the app crashing.What a waste it is. This app is is a complete copy of twitter and also a waste of storage for our android and complete waste of time for ourselves. 😤The text and contents overlap and all letters overlap making it a mess and impossible to use.Great App. Kudos Mark. I hope the experience gets even better in the coming days as more people sign up.The app is amazing and has simple features unlike Twitter where newbies finds it difficult to use. Congratulations to the Meta team for this fantastic and extraordinary 'INSTA TWITTER'!!The experience is very poor. The display after opening threads is not visible and clear.Super app threads, So nice,easily used and covered all india levels..🙃🙃🙃🙃 30 minutes 1millan above view and install it.Why i can't post picture here while everyone can. It stop suddenly right after i click the attachment feature.It very good apps but even better if have translate to other language... For example Thai to English language....Needing an Instagram account to sign up is horrible, I won't use the app until I can make a unique Threads account.I see posts from people I don't follow in my home timeline with no option to disable that. The promised ActivityPub support is still not available.It has been a great app since my day 1 of use, but it's been 2 days now that I can't post a new thread It keeps showing \"your thread failed to upload\" Why?I don't have Instagram and I'm not interested on have one, but the app doesn't work if you don't have an Instagram account... 👎🏼Excellent 👌 app ever but can't able to chat with friends, if possible setup it soon.This app is not working properly, suddenly all the content and icon started overlapping with each other please fix thisHome screen of app is showing overlapping issues. I'm unable to use it. So bad 😞There should not be an option to attach media. Soon there will be a no difference in threads & instagram.Great app but the rate at which I get restricted every time I follow people is annoying. Can't use the app comfortablyWhy after posting a video on this app does the sound disappear? Don't have this issue on TWITTER......I don't know why , Everytime I open this apps it would shake like a broken screen but my screen is not broken though.😷Many people downloaded Theead thinking it was a new alternative to Facebook or Instagram, but it turned out to be a Meta version of Twitter. 😏Its better if you provide save option for photos and videos.So far it's a good app, but I'm just not seeing any notifications pop up on my phone for the people I'm following, please fix it 🥺😔hi! i like it but it doesnt have many of the options that i find useful it this kind of app, i cant even save a photo ☹️Great social network. I'm missing a few twitter features, but hopefully they will come in the future. For now, it's just great.I cant log in both instagram and thread since there was this issue called unmapped ig error. Can you please look into the issueThis app is perfect Especially for young adolescents and teens, one thing I would love to have someday is the dark themeI don't understand why my app keeps on freezing and I can't do anything on it. Does it have device compatability?Stiff 1:1 scrolling makes this essentially unusable as a modern social media app. Just use regular Android scrolling.Too much personal data harvesting. MUCH MORE than chinese tik-tok... Un-installed without using..i like it so far i just don't have any dark mode button my friends are on dark mode and me still on light mode please help.The app was working pretty fine at first but now I am experiencing glitch and unable to do any action.It needs to not be so much like Twitter. Maybe not have everyone in the whole world showing up on everyone's threads. It would be great if I could just have the people/groups I actually follow to show up on my thread. ???A wonderful alternative to other search engines; much better in the realm of privacy and personalisation. Fully recommend to anyone looking for a more secure, honest, simple, user-friendly, and private browser - as well as anyone in general. The wide assortment of ad-blockers and add-ons are wonderful. Ever since switching I will never go back, and I'm very glad that I did. Google Chrome is awful in comparison. Seriously consideredThis apps feela like broken phone you cannot see clearly because all the post the artist is like shaking .App closes whenever I try to post anything. I resort to typing what I want to say externally then pasting it after.The application don't work properly... The interface is weird the letters are overlapping each otherSimple & Sleek. Lacks some basic features like hashtag & trend which should be added in new updates.it's ugly if we see about home page , it's simillar of twitter and it's like just new virsion of it . Try to change the way to use it , it's gonna be more better and it cames with people when you do .Much better than anything else out there but needs hashtags and the ability to tailor your feed.My only experience is when scroll into the feed, it goes crazy. Like really crazyRandom feed sucks. It makes the experience awful and the social app loses its purpose. Terrible experience.The problem is, there's no translation option, I just wish we can translate other language to english :)There is an app crash that I can't do anything at the app and I hope that crash will be fixed soon .No real options to sign up. It wants for me to log in with Instagram, but it has been years since I ha e used InstagramFine but need a lot more work. We need an option to see just the post of people we follow. Translation in the post. Hashtags. Be able to edit posts.I have a bug where i cant use the app beacuse the text is doubled and when i try to scroll it keeps multiplying and i cant read anything and cant use the appIt is glitchy as soon as i scroll my screen, the text leaves it's shadows and merges with the current screenThere is some problem in this app, my follower followed me, we accepted 5 and thought I would do it after a while and went to my hat after a while.Everything is fine, but make some changes like add bold letters for usernames and add double tap to zoomAfter registering, everything are glitchy except the navbar. I cant even use the app, pls fix this! My phone is xperia xz1What to say, its an amazing app with lots of features. It has good UI as well.No tags, no trending just a good copy of twitter with low features and full of insta vibes... Please make the interface looks like realWorst experience as it is not opening even atleast for 2 times i have uninstalled it still not working and now i have uninstalled itMain feed is 10% stuff I want to see 90% is random trash from accounts I don't even follow. If I wanted that I'd be on tiktok.Crashes when uploading bigger photos. Zuck you can do better. Make the app more fun!This is worthless to install app everything is same like insta with some little add one and if you want to delete your thread account u need to delete your instagram too that means these capatalist are forcing u to not uninstall ur account and I can see some privacy data leakage in this app worst app just a big giant company trying to supress the peoples with its capitalist powersWhen I joined threads there were only 12 persons already downloaded I was on 13th to download it this is good app right now but there must should be option for translation any vintect wriiten on the post .There should be same features like Instagram \"Insights\" etc.this app is fantastic but the only problem is that, it is slow when posting videos.i like the app it is really easy to use and is really fitting easy minds and complicated but the reason i am giving 4 star because it is a copy version of TwitterGenuinely horrid experience. Download if you want to be advertised to by a bunch of unfunny people with checkmarks, I guess.An app for this is idiotic. There is nothing this app can do that a web page can't. I don't put garbage apps on my phone and this is firmly in that category.So far so good, it barely came out and I already like it better then Twitter/TikTok, etc. It has that old Twitter nostalgia that I craved.Tried to create an account and it was instantly suspended despite filling in all information correctly.Ita not working in my device after login it buffering while scrolling and showing overlapping post and content.Threads doesn't work properly on Vivo device screen is spread and got stuck please fix this issue...and plzz make it Android 9 versionIt's so fun to use. I have an amazing experience, reading, talking and listening, I love threadsApp is good but some freatures need to improve. For example : threads cannot be edited.Liked it until today when it started crashing. Right now, it won't open at all.I'm going to love this app! At least a stable platform to replace a chaotic experienceIt keeps logging me out of my Instagram account also lack a lot of features including a way to send private text to anyoneThe No.of posts/threads from an unknown account/person(whom I do not follow) on timeline is awkward & Unnecessary thing for a user to through.Chaos on screen .. messages are overlapping to each other, unreadable.. bad bad apps.. still a billion mile away from twitter..I'm not sure if it's ready to be a good app,it needs a lot more than it is, and my opinion is that it shouldn't be a part of Instagram but totally something elseApp is currently pretty bare bones and requires some user setup, but finally a viable twitter alternative.It has been weeks and the app still glitches upon opening till the point that nothing is readable.Its really cool specially in the first version, it also be cool that when we scroll up, see the app icon to tap it and get a better reflesh actionOmg this social media is so amazing and fast. I love this app because i can see information and news Media faster than otheri love it sm, please make this app a safe place. Also,please include making following 'private' and feeds for 'following' only and not from strangers.Its really a nice app for communicating with family and friends and it's very much similar to Twitter.Make search page as trending page, include option to show posts only from the accounts i follow (no suggestions), Include bookmark threads feature with folder option.Not bad. If Twitter is to go out in a blaze of idiocy we could do a lot worse than this to replace it. Could do with a few tweaks here and there (mainly not directly connecting to Instagram for example), but it's still young so I can give it a bit of slack for now.Full on glitches. Not working at all.. Now Its clear why it got only 3.8⭐ stars in less than 24hours of launching.It's great and all. I just wish i could upload audios or record a voice note and postPlease bring the sound in videos which I have uploaded in this app. Voice is not working. please like and follow me. Increase my followers and make my all videos viralNot working on Redmi Note 6 pro. Can't go from one page to another page. Scrolling is not working properlyLooks like Instagram with a different name. If you have insta, you don't need this at all.My app keeps stopping anytime I'm trying to post a picture and I wonder if I can't post other pictures that I have already posted on Instagram bPlease make dark theme. Also if i open any profile then their follow request notification get hidden until i refresh the page.When I try to attach a picture with my threads the app suddenly closes... Can you plz fix this ....I heard it has an easy \"sign in with Instagram\" function to sign up. But that was the ONLY way to sign up.Thread is an amazing App, I just want to see more people using it, because it's the modern day twitter unlike twitter.Amazing app you guys. This came at the right time, honestly. Cause now I can enjoy the thread experience without being worried of my view countehhh could be something but keep getting the error \"your thread failed to upload\" when posting a photo.I just downloaded the thread app , and I fasing a lot of issue . I can't see creator's post properly.News feed is flickering non stop. Can't scroll anything. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.Amazing app better than Twitter. I'm using Twitter for 10 years but not active on it but in thread I used just 1 hour and become addicted. So cool 😎I just installed and then uninstalled, totally wasted, if you don't have any Instagram account, you can't to login in threads, and we all know that Instagram is a su*ks.\"The app is nice, but it still needs improvement, like being able to mention a specific person.\"Very satisfied with this program. Add an edit post option and daily story .It's a great alternative to Twitter. I haven't using Twitter so much, I used it very rare. But I think I will use threads a lot. 😁They loot your photos, videos, browser history, etc... Totally unsafe. Uninstaling threads appLooks much more optimized and easier to use. But we hope that Zuckerberg will not steal our data this time alsojNice app but I need to easily see threads from just the people I follow like on Instagram. Don't need AI to tell me what I like.Not bad. It should allow you to save images and stuff. If this is gonna be a Twitter killer then be a Twitter killer.Wish there was a dm section though. ANNND, save option for pictures (kudos to the high resolution)Such a cozy platform visually, in my opinion. Just cannot scroll through my notifications.... can yall fix it that?Only for Instagram users. I don't have an Instagram account. So I can't use this app as it is asking for Instagram login credentials. Disappointed.Anonymity is a right. My secondary account got banned practically as soon as I created it because I used my username as my \"real name\", even after verifying myself with a live image. Also, no way to search hashtags or cashtags from what I can tell.I love the app so far, my only issue is trying to use it on my iPad, gives log in error messagethere's bug. there are lines on the screen and they pile up. please fix it.This is scary similar to the Twitter app, except many posts appear to be taken down that shouldn't be. NOT the app for free speech. They are definitely losing their intellectual property rights infringement case.App not loading content. When I attempted to post a post on Threads it posted it to Instagram instead? Whaaaat?SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN TWITTER. Thanks for making this app. I already transfered all my Twitter contacts over and everything is working smoothly!So far I like it! Wish I could search key words. Reminds me a bit of tumblr and tumblr has been my home for yearsApp is crushing while posting a thread with photo. Besides it uses more phone ram & lag the whole device.I actually waiting this app and finally wait is over and this is a amazing app . Thanks a @meta team to launching this app . Thanks again ☺️and congratulations meta team the app cross the 10M user's 🎉This app is an amazing app, very interesting, but it doesn't have a future of direct message.Full of glitches While scrolling full of Shaking screen,draging🥴 Fix it up , I already install the app👍 because of that glitches 😕 it is so irritatingThis app doesn't work properly... totally screen are blink doesn't shows the post and activity...Really cool app giving chance for people to grow and connect easily, all we need now is a new update with loads of correctionsPlease fix the app every time I try to post a image it crashes IT'S STUPIDDDDDD but it's not bad I guessI dont want to see algorithmic content at all, but the userbase and integration with Instagram is niceI don’t like the two-in-one app idea. I have to be able to edit, delete threads acount while keeping isntagram's as it isThis app is really cool in my opinion but please add a switch account button because I have to log out to switch account 🤧When is open it all the words including pictures and everything just comes under the like it just gets copied one another 😭I had issues with downloading this app..but came to figure out that some Antivirus apps don't allow it's installation.Not very well application but good for time wasting. Not only this application all applications such as Instragram Twitter and all meta app are time wasting.The app idea is awesome, but there are so much filkering and overlaps while scrolling, the device is Xiaomi Redmi s2 3g ramI think twitter is for reliable and easy to use. Threads only display the posts of followed people's.1 star because my feed is full of suggested rubbish that I don't want to see just like Facebook and Instagram. I should only see posts from people I follow. Im sick of meta throwing complete nonsense on to our newsfeedssince the moment i downloaded this app, my instagram keeps crashing. it's not even letting me open the app.Dude this app is glitching so hard, I wish I could show you the ss, not able to use it even for a sec.Great start, missing a couple features but it's a great base to build off ofI have been face some problem. When I will be a post every times it's will be failed. So you should solve this problem as soon as possible.there is a bug at the application when i open it and login at my acc. and opened home the application melting over itselfI would love to be able to post to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, all at once.I have rated one star cuz actually I haven't used it yet , everytime i open the app it lags and it's terrible I can't use it cuz all things are in each others I can't describe anymore about my problemThis app doesn’t work perfectly in Android 9 (Redmi 6A). Screen freezes when scrolling.Great app but add an option to create account without Instagram. I like threads but I hate using Instagram.Somehow UI is completely distorted for me. Everything is overlapping over each other.This App have many bugs, first of all it is not load properly on Android and don't show post clearly.Switching between thread account unlike Instagram or Facebook is not flexible. We need to logout and switchApp keep crashing whenever I should upload a photo !!! Not a good start for thread !!The application is nice, but it needs some modifications, such as translating the postsI need to easily view photos and videos.This is so hard to use . When I view a photo I want to back 🔙 and view another photo that is hardAs of now, there is nothing wrong with it, and it will surely give good feedback when it says that it belongs to Instagram....this app litterary cracks and shakes like my screen has got issues but it doesn't if it did i would not be commenting on this app peacefully pls can this issue be fixedWhat is this! I can't handle this app in my phone. When I open it ,it's like display broken screenMy threads app has been glitching continuous, I even reinstalled it once but still nothing has changed.At first glance, UI is pretty dope (mid between twitter & Instagram). Kinda like it.AN APP WITH VERY BASIC AND GROSS FEATURES. WILL TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO TAKE TWITTER'S POSITION. THREADS IS NOT THAT SERIOUS AS TWITTER. IF YOU DON'T NEED THIS...DON'T USE IT.It's a good App, it has features of Instagram and Twitter all mixed up in one place.If you want to be better and compete with Twitter you have to have Trending Topics. Newsworthy stories not just celebrities posting. That's what made Twitter famous because people came there to see what was going on in the world.Signed up for threads go instantly suspended now I've got to upload a selfie with a code when I have done nothing wrong just wanted to use the app.Poorly designed app, at least expecting if cloned but still expecting some ui and functional changes and new approaches rather than just copy pasteScreen scrolling speed very slow. To compare other app, Screen refresh rate very low in this appNo draft icon, on the other hand the feeds refresh is slow. Moderately a good app thoFeed is quite unorganized. Slow refresh. Congested interface.Least app just like Instagram it only increase your dopamine there is no info no intresting debates, all come like today I tried this food and it's awesome, all boomer talks 😁 waste of timeI rate 2 stars because I can't change my profile picture in it and it's bugging me out please fix this issue.Let the new updated feed be upside. Don't take us to the top of the updated feed when the feed is refreshed.broken... I know it's a new app but on android version of the app even the slightest scroll down I get the ghost screen error ☹️Unable to upload or post a photos... Pls fix the Bug.. (upload time automatically app closed).Keep crashing while im still writing a content. Fix it with haste, or ill give a permanent 1 startSo far it was good. Please fix the bug where when i log in my Threads Instagram app logs out and then that logs out the Threads appfine app but lack of feature and junkie UI makes the user experience very bad.Your this app is also perfect as hell but like Insta, she will never accepts my request🙂 zuck if you are reading this please tell her I also do Exist. Thank you!Lots of bugs, i still cannot add a photo to my thread, the app keep closing on its ownIt's just a knock-off of Twitter filled with liberals and celebrities who didn't like Elon removing a lot of censorship. So if you don't like free speech, can't handle someone else's opinion or just make everything about yourself, you'll love this app. For myself, though, I like hearing opinions, having debates, and not seeing a one-sided narrative of society. This app is a joke, it freezes half the time too. Just stick with Twitter, this app sucks just like Facebook...@instagram the threads app i installed but its not work correctly (after open the app posts ,followers ,account details are mixed in one tab)I wish you would add the clubhouse feature so we could talk together again, it would be really greatHorrible it's a piece of garbage. I think Meta tried to punch Twitter 🤦🏻‍♂️. Five minutes later I hated the app, and I'm currently thinking of deleting my Instagram account.Very generic. You also can't delete without deleting your Instagram account. Privacy concerns.Scrolling isn't smooth as instagram but the App is great the features are okay.But they should improve on some thingsIf you used before Twitter, u definitely gotta use this. U gotta have a instagram acc to use this though. This app have NO ADS (NO ADS AT ALL). I hace a question here though, do we have dark theme?Seems Cool, but it creates a lot of typo error and you can't edit your thread after posting.The app threat people like a product and not a person. Taking your every detail including your personal health information... No wonder it can't show it's face in the EU. 🤦🏾Connecting and redirecting to Instagram resets the Threads' profile. And then shows partial data from Instagram. Test it well team 😗🤏🏼So far so good the app has been fun and great but now it keeps on crashing and my phone reports it has a bugA general flexible and nice app, missing some features but if it's one thing I know about mark Zuckerberg he always brings the updatesIt's animations are Good plus some other features but otherwise completely copy of twitter completely not recommendIt's Awesome but there is no massage option. Twitter is better than threads. I think the massage option must need in threads.Incredibly primative version of twitter. Needs lots of work done. Released too early.Ui are good and intuitive, anyway the community not large enough and cannot search or see the trend of the hashtags.The app isn't working properly, while trying to use this, I can't even read a single text. It's so annoying.Hi ! this rate is the first, literally! I give it one cuz it forced me to log in by Instagram and I didn't have one !Love the ease of use so far but can't seem to post a photo (even after resizing)Hi. Experiencing several crashes in my handset (Vivo Z1 Pro). Please fix the crashes.I didn't choose to follow all the people I followed on ig but my feed is so messy and I'm seeing a lot of posts from people I didn't follow! defeats the purpose 🤷🏻‍♀️This is just a terrible clone of Twitter... Blue check the lot, a bug ridden mess. Uninstalled.The app is smooth but it is crashing when I try to pull up a previous reply.What a great app. I have been using for 3 years until. Hope to see amazing slots game and gambling Ads 😘Extremely basic, lacks the most simple (and often most important) features an app of this category should have. Half the app is mangled together with IG, you can't really personalize your profile, it's slow, has the same policies as IG, isn't privacy friendly, doesn't have a chronological feed and some of the very few options it does have simply don't work. The only pros I could find is that it looks pretty and is relatively organized, but it doesn't come close to the competitor. 3/10Finally, An app that can truly Rival Twitter, still needs more fine-tuning but this app clearly has so much potentialThe no ads UI is good, for now. Picture quality is good, tooit's a nice app but there could be some improvements like gif attachments and the scrolling isn't really smoothApp is all good but can you guys please save this app from dark politics and please add translating option for foreign languagesThread is good app. Interesting and userfriendly interfaces. That's why i give 5 star.It's a good app and growth quickly 💕💕 but it's bad features are blue tik of every celebrate not get common people 😔An open Social Media app without a BOOKMARK OPTION is a big failure. Hope u add it very soon.I have glitch in this app firstly I enetered all was working but after my second enterance the app hot glitched in which there were 2 oberlays in that solve this problem plzLooks like you have to have an Instagram account, I don't have one and don't want one, so Threads is getting uninstall.The whole thing is broken or bugged. Texts are overlapping... Please fix it.Better than Twitter. easy to use . got connected to old knows easily. just waiting some exciting updates 😊For me now this app before I updated it is working very well, since I update it not allowed me to Post either picture or note don't know what happenedWant too much personal data, just a knock off lesser version of Twitter. Another personal data farm of the FB branch.I think mine have bugs, cause it keeps lagging, even i multiple times i re download it still keeps getting lagit's crashing a lot when I upload pics and refreshing my feed, my feed won't even refresh unless if it crashesDownloaded to try it and see if I wanted it. Hadn't realised I needed an Instagram account, which I don't have. I don't feel like selling soul to Zuckerberg today so I'm deleting.it doesn't work properly everytime i scroll the text will be doubled and overlap to eachotherI already have twitter. I don't need another app to eat my RAM, drain the juice and yes we all know how META handles our senstive data 🤣.I love it. I hope to see an audio chat room. That is what most of us really want, especially us from TwitterCan't remove the bottom 3 phone buttons and that's where the app puts all the confirmation buttons so the app is unusableNew bug : when i am trying to see my coment replay / automaticly back and closing the app. Please fix this🥺Translation option is needed. Feed for only following is needed. Auto-play check is needed.Pretty good so far! I wish there were ways to see what's popular or trending....hopefully it gets added in the future!This is a very good social media platform, it is much better than twitter, I hope that the application will continue to work well.Keyboard covers letters on screen when typing. And add edit to typing options for one to easily alter writings with ease.Update.. Still sucks after updates today July 19th. Just put it in chronological order like Twitter does and everything will be perfect I don't want to see threats from people I don't follow Seems nice but what the hell all I see is people that I don't follow I go check off thread only people I follow and yet I still see Toys R Us in my timeline like why I just want to see who I follow in chronological order of the time they send a message have the people who created this and never use Twitter?It can still be better if more features are added. 3 stars for first experience.Not joining this garbage. 1 because you cannot make Instagram function properly starting at basic commenting on posts! 2, this is a money grab. F you tech billionaires. You don't need more money!So far, the app is amazing. I love it for its simplicity and minimalist vibe. That being said, I have a few suggestions regarding the 'following' feature. It's quite hard to check the followers one by one to check whether I followed them already or not. So, aside from the \"'remove\" option, perhaps you can add a feature where we can easily check if we are mutuals with that user.It works well though in the followers part you can't notice who is a mutual follower and who's not until you open up the profile.Very disappointed of this app. It's not that much worth that my phone has it. I would like to say don't download this. Poor quality. Poor management.This App Is very smooth and user friendly to use. Its just like Twitter 2.0 , i hope we can see some new features in this app in future, altho awesome app.Stupid and big privacy issues! You give away more info than other platforms and can't delete your account! Massive fail Zuck, you absolute p.o.s.Want to attach screenshots of the problem I am facing. Screen got shivering while I am entering into it and it is the worst😠Uninstalling. This app collects so much data that it might as well be spyware.Threads is currently glitchy on my side, with the text distorting and covering my whole screen.Just make it where you can rotate for landscape photos and videos and we're goodFirst of all ,this app simply easy to use, by all means can u guys make an update about adding some translation words ,thanks...I give 5 star but the developer should make something important which is the ability to download image videos etcI see way too many posts by accounts I don't follow. Twitter allowed me to only see the accounts I follow in my timeline. Stop with the suggested posts please, this isn't Instagram. And no snoozing of suggested posts. When I turn something off, I want it to stay off.You have to have an Instagram account, which will scour your phone and take all your personal information. No thanks, so I guess I'm sticking with TwitterIt shows a lot of ads and promoted accounts! Even more than Instagram does.Keep it simple and don't add cringe features like you did with Instagram.If only i can register in this app instread of donwloading instagram to register as well... Kinda foolish, because not everyone is an instagram user and i do not intend to use instagram.I love it so much to be honest but i think it would fun if it has like private chats like Instagram but overall it's amazingThis app is like a baby of Instagram, haha jk, it's good but still needs some improvements but great.<3Good app, needs a way to save the photos and videos. And a react button like Facebook hasI my Android mobile this app is not working properly the screen is overlapping. So I am requesting Instagram Team to fix it plsMy favourite “Threads” tip so far: Easily reshare any message to your IG story by tapping the paper airplane (share) icon and then selecting “Add to Story”Not yet a good App. Needs improvement. It crashed and it glitches.Missing really basic features at launch, but I believe this could be a great app after some updatesI can't even see anything when I open the app, a lot of bugs andnothing appears correctlyWhen I open the app the app loads over the existing post screen and it hangs and unable to use at allSo... how about a feature to save media.. like.. save photos or something.Nope, still connected to instagram and all Meta's data , can't be trusted .Yeah this is way more nicer and easier to use than Twitter just add DMS camera maybe even like reels or something like that and this app doesn't have any glichesi can't open the app, when i opened it the app was suddenly stopped working or log out automatically.Has nothing to offer that Twitter doesn't other than very strict guidelines on what you can say. The only reason this app even exists is to data harvest.Good, but we should get an option to turn off recommended threads cause we don't care about a lot of these content creators.Awesome application there are some bugs that need to fix but it's a great startShow me the updates from the people that I FOLLOW. Why pushing random accounts to the feed? I haven't come across a single friend's account in the last two days.Interface visual bugs at all. I can't see anything, just picsThe animations are great but the scrolling experience is just wack It feels like scrolling on a sandpaper Refine itIn my opinion, this is the better app from Twitter. It gives us a better user experience and reliability. It is more similar like a Twitter.It doesn't display properly like the wordings are overlapping each other. Pls solve it thanksNot helping at all, i just started a journey to get my audience and it doing nothing, wat de hecc, why zucc's social media (beside facebook and whatsapp) are useless.Off to a great start! I finally have something else to play other than that far right conspiracy theorists Angry Bird app.There is a need of DARK MODE button in the settings... Other than that, everything is good...Buggy. Keeps crashing on Pixel 6. I had to uninstall and download again twice now.When i open the app the gets glitch... When i scroll down or up it gets overlap one after another plz resolve...This app just gave me a heart attack because now I came to now about it that if I delete this app my instagram account will also get deleted. Just bring a new update to unlink my account. Or bring any solution for deleting it.Very easy to use and not so crowded like instagram, more to read than see.Screen getting stuck and texts are overlapping whenever opening the app.The amount of personal data collected is unbelievable. Very unsafe and dangerous.It looks like Instagram is controlling you on thread.. should have more freedom in terms of account access/changes in profile/controlsWaiting for new features to come, but looks like a really good Twitter alternative!It's a cool platforms just as addictive as Instagram....just needs a few fixes but i like itThey really need to fix the glitches and bugs on Instagram first before launching clone apps.So far a much better replacement for Twitter. Not perfect, but has infinitely more promise than Twitter.Such a waste app full of glitches. Scrolling isn't working at all. Please look into itAfter using my account for a few days my account was blocked. I haven't even made a post, they just decided I wasn't me. I'm signed in through my Facebook account, which isn't locked.Bad experience not working properly you have to work on interface really disappointed.The agree button on the terms page when signing up doesn't do anything and you can't get past itHas potential, but I hope they add in a search tab so you can search hashtags instead of home feed only.This app has a big problem like Instagram, automatic download of videos, why should I download videos that I never want to see?!Could really use a feed just for accounts I'm following. Would also be nice to have themed icon support for Android 13+.App is Good But Thread App need More improvement like Missing \"Thred Inbox\" or save photos or videos or varification request please fix all problems of this app !Malfunction: showing multiple texts! Making it unable to read a thing.A very nice experience with the app, one week into the app and I'd say it's better off Twitter..... looking forward to the new update....that's pretty good, but you forgot the dark mode in the app please, when you'll update the dark mode I'll come back to fill the last two star🌟No tablet / foldable layout. Also missing account switching. But it's not Twitter 👍🏼Can't post pictures. It keeps force closing when I try to post any.App is pretty smooth and clean on the first day itself. Very impressedseems good so far, but unfollowing people doesn't register so you're stuck following them along with the other bugs mentionedI want to use this app but why the hell I need an Instagram accout to do so. Means I am forced to create an Instagram account or this platform is solely for meta existing user not for new ones.Been on here 2 hours, but there are bugs like, LOTS OF BUGS. threads failing to upload mostly.my first time using app but this app is totally glitching screen but everything like scrolling yes it can but the screen app is glitch, just fix the app :(Good app so far I wish there was an option to translate and also the ability to dm .I have been using this aap from this morning and this is actually very neat and clean, really simple and user friendly. Hope it stays like this. I prefer Threads over Twitter. 5 stars.So forced to see a whole bunch of people I can't care about and the amount of personal data the app wants is positively asinine.Not a stand alone apps requiring an Instagram account... Not Interested if there are strings attached 🧵The app doesn't open from the external links. Links only open in the web browser.It is lagging and glitching too much ... I am not able to use it.. So frustratingBest app. But give some good features like chat and trending page. Good luck to developer.Everything works, but I need a chronological timeline that only shows me threads from people I follow.Cleaner content than Twitter, so far, but you can't search topics amongst public posts/threads? Yikes.I hope you add hashtages and organise the home page since it's full of people that I don't know(and it's quite messy).This app isn't working properly...🤮 I can't upload my profile picture and I can't share threads on my Instagram storyAs an advocate of free expression and an ardent believer in the power of open dialogue, I found the experience of using the speech-controlled social media app nothing short of a regressive nightmare. Instead of fostering an environment that encourages diversity of thought and robust discussions, this app imposes a heavy-handed system that curtails individual liberties and stifles meaningful interactions.There is a bug on my apps everytime i try to scroll my threads Everything become fizzy and can't read anything Please fix it, my device is redmi note 6 proNeeds more edit settings and cleaner ui along with easier posting all and all i like the algorithm keep it like thatBecause it is a thread app why do you limit the number of post a person can like. Like now Its like try again later. Limited actions let it remain on InstagramSo it's good but I am wondering why my profile picture has refused to display on my thread account, I have a verified account so I cannot manually change my profile picture its been over 24 hours and it still has not displayed...Good app, missing some basic features which they say are in dev also get a few force closes/crashes occasionallyIt is very useful to use compared with Twitter..but it's has a minor problem like put translation for all threads for users.Constantly crashing trying to upload a photo, otherwise a good place with positive energyEncountered blurry display when scrolling looks the layer of the text and background overlappingI think I like it so far EXCEPT I don't want to have a feed full of people I don't follow. If someone I DO follow reposts, then fine, show me. But don't give me an algorithm of threads that are pointless for me.Content feed is full of people I neither know, nor have ever heard of. Scrolling forever to see anyone I follow. Just going to keep using Mastodon.Hello threads, this app is clean and clear, feel great to read on it, oh it reminds me of those old good days of tweeter just to tweet our openionNeed Twitter Alternative. With the takeover of Elon Musk on Twitter, the platform was becoming quite unstable. Now, with tough alternatives in the marketplace, there's going to be some stability.You can't create a new account. You have to use an already existing instagram account. Also, there is no website on PC. Useless.Not the best..... its same as twitter layout but worse. Not for me. I've got too many socials already. And only use 3 don't want to add moreNot bad I guess there's not much to show it's just post from random people no way of messaging I guess need more updates Instagram is better than Threads as for twitter vs Threads - twitter win if Instagram and twitter they're good you can't not win the twitter using threads it's better to use Instagram instead Facebook is better than threads!I love the interface and overalls, although i hope it'll have translations soon.Sorry to here there is no windows app for the new Instagram Threads app. Also you are unable to log into the site on a windows computer, tablet or laptop.An application bug appeared, everything turned off and nothing works, reinstallation did not helpIt's glitching so much that I can't even scroll through the page (or any page literally!)Add a draft feature. Add a dm feature. Add a VN sharing feature.....And this app will be ready to compete with twitter but until then Twitter is far betterThe app ia good and fun but i have a problem using the app ,, the written laters reflect with each other and doaent looks so good 😏😏There is some bug I think whenever I'm going to upload something.the app automatically closed🤷🏻‍♂️ fix this.Nice app minimal and simple , just add one feature, for switch account like Instagram without log out....Yall experiencing pages and posts overlapping each other... Go to profile, theres button at the top right corner then report a problem.. just go there then go back to homepage and the bug's gone☺️Threads are very slow to load. Please fix. And please add edit button.It's glitching like hell, I can't even TRY the app, cause as soon as I open it it's just A COMPLETE GLITCHThe experience is too short to share. It's been only two days of it's launch. Until now, loving it.Application is really good but we can't able to logged in more accounts at a one time like instagram.You are just signing IN to an Instagram account. You cannot sign UP for a NEW Thread account, so all they are doing is transfering Instagram members into Thread members. Seems like a good way to limit conversations to only those they already know. Sort of like the Democrats calling themselves something else to register more votes. Sneaky ploy.Good app but looks like its still in beta mode with lots of functions still needs to be implementedi like it I think it will be very good if it adds the ability to categorize the threads.If you want to be censored and you want to be shafted for one side of the conversation. This is the app that you need to use. Nobody wanted anything made by Facebook. Facebook is a terrible app and this is second half to it.There is no dark mode,When I logged in it was light mode only by default, but in my friends phone it was dark mode by defaultThere's a big glitch in the whole app, I can't describe it through words but you have to watch itI guess its the first review from india. This app was released just a few days ago and its so smooth like it was there all the time.Great start! Please add the option to edit in some form!The app was okay until it stopped reloading, keeps saying \"something went wrong\" pls fix itMy tread having bug/glitch this is why my thread don't work anyway so please check it out and repair it! My Instagram I'd :- abuu.talibbIt actually have a lot of bugs! Thread team should fix the bug first before it launched!Real close, very good, lots of hope. Just keep it simple and you win easily.It is a good alternative to Twitter, one advantage is that it prohibits explicit content.Would it be that hard to choose my preferred language? My local posts are garbage I have muted more people than i have liked threads I like the way the app functions thoughno ways to discover new accounts, no hashtags, no in-app messages, app has potential but falls flatIn my redmi note 6pro Threads app will crashes continuously and didn't works well,it should be a negative for me as a user of meta ,VERY VERY BAD META TEAM, so meta team please make the issue correct by giving a stable update of THREADSNot bad! Let's not compare you with Twitter, already, as I feel Twitter is still very much ahead in the curve. With hashtags, keyword searching and trending updates round the clock and so much more. But you have the potential Threddy. Go for it! Feedback? Sure. 1. Bring (Twitter) Lists and position them in a similar way as Twitter. 2. DMs. 3. A separate 'Followers only threads' for the TL. 4. Hashtags and keyword searching (if the plan is to actually compete with Twitter).I liked it very much infact it is an awsome start of all new platform particularly when most of the netizens were feeling bored 😀 Good Luck to Threads ✌️Threads is app which replaces Twitter and very exciting to start threads but there is a problem on refresh the page please solve this.Nice app which will help us to be connected with the latest news and updates and with our loved ones.please, PLEASE let me see ONLY accounts that I FOLLOW. I keep seeing people and stuff i don't care about on top, and have to scroll pretty far down just to see people i actually follow... and that's just super annoying.cant post gifs they come out purple and green and distorted and am not the only one that is happening to fix the appThe home screen got a big glitch, the words are spreading around . Please fix itSometimes force closed and search bar result nothing oftenly. And now can't see following listIt didn't work properly. Some glitche is happend during usage. Worst experienceApp seems like it was clearly forced out to capitalize on Twitter controversy, but it has a lot of potential!This app needs a lot of work i cant refresh in general it looks fine cant complain but keeps shutting downI can't log in as I am not receiving the login confirmation code. Might be that I am from Australia, not sure ☹️This app has potential, but it needs an explore option, hashtags, and promotion.The app is great but it keep stopping everytime I attach a picture to the thread.Good start but it does feel rushed with all of the missing features.UI crashes on every interaction. App totally unusable.Needs more features (especially followibg only page) and themes options bc it looks pretty boring but its p good so farRetarded, you can't search for anything by keyword or #Tag. It shows only accounts!Super App which is connected to Instagram. Hopefully more updates will come there soon.Would be nice if they add a dark mode for AMOLED and OLED phones better for battery life I guess .Its great and positive so far but still there are some features missing..Needs more bandwidth, it keeps crashing when I go to post something.You have to be an Instagram user before you can use Threads. That makes it seem like a bit of a bait-and-switch if you just want to use Threads.Not a mind to be found. Like Twitter, but for the dull-normal. If you like fake positivity, corniness and old memes, you've found your app.Nice & u can download it's it's just useful for getting updated and news of all around the globeIt's a great app. I love it but to the developers I want say that Where is the dark theme? Thread is glitching in my phone dark mode😐😐Please add a media feed like instagram, so it will be easy to see media and please make the picture can be saved tooSo far so good I would like to put this out there please please make sure that this platform stays Scam free we don't need or want it. And please keep it free from hate only advertisement s from real business not scamsThis is awesome app but thread is connected with instagram. Mark Zuckerberg sir please make an app which integrates all meta platform app in one place.Sometimes when a person followed me, the notification won't show up so I don't realize thatInitial impression was like walking into a town square, where there are thousands of people shouting random stuff that you don't care about, all hoping to attract the biggest crowd.Pretty good so far. Even though if I want to delete my account I have to delete my Instagram as well. Still better than Twitter under Twitters current circumstances.First experience was the worst, installation took ages and after logging in, I cannot scroll down the activity page....Still new, my problem is some picture from phone gallery can't share it will forced closed the app.Just add feature to download images & turn night mode on/off in the app itself.Bug report: some photos unable to upload, and unable to view the reason of the failure to uploadI changed my insta password and now threads won't let me even open the app, let alone a login screen or anythingThere is no option to sign up without an Instagram account. DOUBLE WACK!It's a great app, but it's crashing when I try to upload a photo. Please have a lookI can't attach a file in my thread, while i attach a file the app closes .... OkAll settings are good...but u need to clear bugs in threads...coz can't refresh my page .😕This app is crashing everytime when I open this app so I kindly requested to remove that crashPerfect. But could we please have downloading the photos and videos option?Broken app, the screen glitches so bad. I can't use it at all.Hello developers i am not a user of instagram but want to use a threads please allow section for new signups rather than just login from instagram if its there then please make it more visible because I am not able to reach thereDon't like social media, never had a Twitter account, but I like the idea of Twitter going bust due to all the bad choices by Elon Musk, so downloading this and signing up to help out boost it's numbersthe app crashes when i try to upload photos. it's so annoying.Easy, simple ui and functions and very enjoyable, waiting for more featuresI was facing some problem while using this app , Actually when i start using this app there was a glitch my screen get stuckCompetition breeds innovation, despite my distaste for meta at times what they're doing will surely shake up the industry.This is too disappointing that app does not working.. like every where is too much glich the font are displaying on anotherThese app is incredible They is no other app like this in the social media marketing this is the best. THREADERS assemble Just yesterday I joined I have 100k+ follower I wish this app would make sure we can chat anyone privately please 🥺Why it's not opening for the access it's not running also if you want to delete this it not happeningoverall is good, but please fix when i will post media, the apps goes to so laggy. So i hope it's get fixi have re-installed three times but coding is not accurate its been hiking and tripling the wordsAwesome apps, I really love this apps, more than the blue one. Stay wordy, please..Also include podcasts, make it like clubhouse app where friends can discuss with audio.Very nicely done, would like the option to use GIFs without having to upload themThe app is good but we need the save pictures button and dms and I can't change mine to dark modeAmazing engineering for an app to open up with such an influx of users without major bugs or crashes.Inability to easily switch between profiles makes this less useful than other options.First time opening threads and it instantly crashed can't even do anything it crashes without any message pls fix thisIt’s need good amount of Update and also need to allow only following people post in feed and also need to add the HASHTAG It's THE MOST IMPORATANT THING :>Improvements needed not very catchy... Nothing close to twitter's interface.. it's just another app...What is this glitch? The texts in the app threads is converging...... Fix this glitch as soon as possible 😒😠Signed up, seeing nothing but utter rubbish, people who like the sound of their own voices.I'm getting duplicate notifications, even though I have a public account I'm being asked to approve follow requests.There is a glitch in this app. Cant use it properly till now. Hope it will get fixed soon.It so amazing app more than what people can think or though about it its special app for each and everyone that life on the earth.I know it can't be exactly like T!, but it just doesn't function properly. It's going to need some improvements. Until then I'm on that other app.Very stable and almost no bugs, good job meta team, this will be big.Interface seems so crowded and messed up. Don't feel like using this at allThreads not working in my device . Maybe a glitch or something I don't know. I have sent an email please have a lookThis app keeps bugging many times, I can't upload photos, its just log out by itselfIt can beat twitter. Nice app but more features can be added and i guess they are coming sooner...Passwords is not getting saved. During account switch every time I should put password for login.There's the bug that shows many layers, can't use well like that.Twitter rehash I guess? Never felt strongly for twt so idc about that. Seems okay so far, I think it's been like 3 days since launch. Biggest complaint: I only want to see posts from people I actually follow... preferably without having to mute a million people thanksGreat content, much better than a scammer platform eh eh (Hyperloop, flying cars, self driving taxi's, and FSD)i love the ui , its really cute and clean/neat to use! really gives me the familiarity of Instagram too!It looks fun, and was, until everything stopped loading and then the app made me unfollow about 40 people from my InstagramI'm not interested in opening an Instagram account just to try out Threads. So it's an immediate uninstall for me...Fun and clean but needs some details like backgrounds, private messages and others.It's literally Twitter, but from Meta. So you already know your data is not safe and there is no free speech.App crash when I want to select a two lines text in right to left language My phone's language in English ...I can't log in with my Instagram. Keep telling me something went wrong, app not independent. SadAs is it's impossible to use. I do not have an Instagram account. I cannot use the app without creating an Instagram account. You cannot create an Instagram account from within the app. Ergo the app is impossible to use without already having an Instagram account or going to Instagram to create an account outside of the app. 0/10Great so far but it needs a translation button. Am I missing where to translate a post?Ugly UI and it feels so slow. Why does this company continue making bad apps/site? Nice job bootlicking verification, as if anybody with 1 braincell cares about that stuffAbsolutely pointless, doesn't show my follows, but instead spams me with random stuff.I really like it! Easy to use. Converts instagram following & followers instantly too.This is incredible and feel cool with the linkage Instagram and I hope we can linked this to Facebook with WhatsApp.Please add trending features in search, and trending @ ... Very good develop more and give more featuresWhen it automatically become dark mode it crashes everything. Can't even scroll upAt first I am not familiar with this. But when I installed it and started using I get more followers and like in my post and reels. It's really interesting. Thanks Instagram 🙂UI is flickering & totally a mess, after installing android app.Best social app I've ever seen! Now I can connect with you Instagram friends!!Finally, a better alternative to the awful bin fire that is Twitter. Time to make real time updates and discussion safe for everyone again!Great & simple socmed app, on Android, please add options on attachment so we can choose image from Albums100x times better than Twitter. My twitter feed feels like a trash. It's so messed up. we really needed it 😭😁Easy to use, very intuitive UI. Join the funBest App Alternative to Twitter. Account Login is So Easy with Instagram account 😄. Keep Developing and Also please Don't allow poltics inside the app like TwitterWhy is the app suddenly crashing and showing multiple posts at a time like it has crashedInitially good, waiting for more improvements in the user interface optionsJust amazing, the UI looks super cool and very smooth! 🔥I want to create an account just for this app and not for Instagram. It seems like I cannot do that at the moment, so this app is useless.Not getting post notifications from followed accounts. Replies & likes yeh. All my notifications are on.1.No hashtags 2.Unable to 📌 pin the threads ➿ on top . But one thing I like no limit on content or letters on a thread ➿ Good 👍.Can't say much since I'm experiencing alot of glitches, hope it fets better with an update since I can't wait to use the appYes... But frequently crash. Threads are not synchronise many times.App lags while uploading high quality pictures. Throw you out from the app.Can't upload photo! Tends to upload it from gallery, suddenly app exits...So far this app is sounding very promising. Let's see if the pace picks up in a few weeks!This app is not working getting glitch type bug in it ...!! Need update ASAP!!Good start, but missing key features like the explore section of twitter.It's working really well, please add themed icon support for Android.It is essentially Twitter minus the Elon Musk stench. Pretty good. Needs a trending subpage though, would make it perfect.The ui looks horrible, I feel like I'm in a IfunnyX comment section. Even the LegoLife app has a better layout!Love it! Everything works and the app seems like it's only going to get better. Good work everyone.It bugs the first time that i used it is okay but after like 20 hours maybe because there's a lot of users are using at the past 24 hours, my followers on Instagram account is what I saw on my threads and all of my post Is gone hahaha like I only sleep for 4 hours then after that deleted allHave high hopes but not sure why I need an Instagram account. Else could use personal email or something.I Could Love This App, If It Would Stop Showing My An Bunch Of People I Don't Follow More Than The People I Do. I Do Not Want Suggested Post In My Main Feed. Make It So I Can Filter Them Out Or Completely Remove It.Very good app, I have just joined. I have liked it very much and all other people should also download it brothers. Well done brother!Just signed up to threads like it the only thing missing is widgets to be able to see it on the screenWorks well & I'm enjoying it so far. There are a few features I'd like them to add in the future.12m downloads in very less time is just amazing. Let see how this apps works. Am just looking for one thing. Does this app offer freedom of speech? Because meta did not but Twitter does.App looks promising but missing some key features like hashtags, trending topics and DMs. Hope it will catch up soon and will take the toxic twitter out of the equationWould rate it higher if the translate feature can be integrated like in Facebook and InstagramWould have rate it a 5 if the reels options in Instagram were available and some of the Instagram featuresIt has been a very successful application, it has a few shortcomings, but I think they will be completed. I lovedIt's good, I just need my in-app name to be independent from instagram, aswell as account switchingIt's just like it's rival but , it lets you automatically follow your Instagram followers/ following.Just way more user friendly than twitter. Easy to sign up if you already insta as well.Good start but the Android version needs a dark mode in the worst way.It's kinda slow when it comes into unfollowing people. I've unfollowed one account twice but it still appears that I'm following her. How ridiculous 😂Not able to find direct sharing options from insta or auto sync as what I expectedNeed #hashtags, $cashtags, search function for text, bookmarks, DMs and draft functionality to make it remotely usable.trash app. theres no settings and missing very basic features.I have a problem where I rethread mark Zuckerberg post and then it simply looks there two rethread in my timeline even though it is the same post. Hope u can fix itFelt kinda comfortable in this app! Don't knw why but it's friendly and kinda better than Twitter.Having Glitch on my account Interfreace that is not showing things clear like full page is shaking and being blury so please look at it...I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a Meta app but it works as described. And every star helps Elon to be a bit more miserable.Good app, nice features.... Now underrated people can get some reach without reels.Good. But if follow several people at once, always showing restricted massages. That's nonsenseUnable to upload pictures. The app keeps crashing.Keep improving We need to edit post after posting; spell mistakes, auto correct and change of mind etc... You know 😉It's really a nice app and will beat Twitter but the issue I'm facing is profile picture syncing issueNeed dms , dark mode and save option like Instagram. Or else it's good.Installed today 6th July 2023. Threads is currently tied to Instagram account. But the link to Instagram and Facebook should be optional. It should be a standalone app like Facebook or twitter.The issue was finally fixed.... woohoo 🎉 I feel like kissing you guys.....but lol that'd be thru the phone, great work!Glitchy on my device. Can't view anything. It just goes double-triple visionToo much of glitch. Can't use The app at all as it glitches continuously.Develop the best space than that of Twitter and more other cool features but its so cool Ctrl+C & Ctrl+VHope you got the user name you wanted on Instagram. This feature less app can't do anything... All account stuff is run through insta. DOA.Threads is a new app, built by the Instagram team, for sharing text updates and joining public conversations....It's glitching. Texts are cascading over other texts and picturesI can't post pictures, it's keeps crashing when I choose pictures and press donei hope... with this new apps, my store can increase revenue, branding, and productivity. 5 Stars For META, Cheers Universe.We are the early users of Threads app. I want our next generation to see this review and know that we were the early users of these threads apps but after I joined these threads apps I will add many memories with these apps which I will miss a lot in future.❣️🥰🧡When I scroll down or up, my whole display just messed up with the letterers. Fix it ASAP @Mark_JuckerburgIt's early days so we will see where this app goes. But could the billion dollar company behind Instagram and now Threads please work out how to make an app for tablets/foldables too... I mean come on...It's taking many permissions and while using heating the phone. It's a trap for looting dataWhy am I opening another app to connect more app. To view the same things I would view on the previous app pages?More like insta and doesn't look like it had more of idea to be created I can edit my review based on changes brought by Meta but for now ... it just looks like insta without reelsI do not plan on allocating time to this app, apart from the time setting up this app as private, as I am the author of: cups of tea songbookA great alternative to Twitter, filled with a fun community and is very safe for people.I wish it wasn't a separate application and was connected and inside Instagram!I am also new to this app. 🙋‍♂️ This app is moving very fast and seems to be aiming to overtake Twitter😬Please fix the feed , there's some people facing me every time when i enter the app , i need to see what i follow,not suggestions please!Not optimised upto now... Screen continuosly blinking and flashing.The feed, why do i have to see the trash posts by the whole humanity.. There should be a feed to see only people i follow and what interests me.. Why the hell should i see the trash celebrities, girls, actors, cringe memes and what not..I installed this app yesterday and used it for few hours. Currently I don’t see any difference in this app however in future it might have some different features.Seems ok,but my only gripe so far,is that you cannot see what you are writing due to the keyboard being over it!So far, so good. Easy to move profile, etc. From Instagram to threadsThe app glitches a lot.. Im not able use it because of the glitches.. They ssrly need to work on itThreads app is not working properly I got heavy glitches when I open the app everytime.If switching to multiple accounts could be as easier as Instagram it would be convenient tooApp doesn't work in many devices, hangs everytimes... Need immediate update...I have just got ot amd I love it, it is really good quality and I think they did great job with the app:)Worst app. What you are building guys. Instagram + Facebook= threads. What's a worst product idea guys. Same as 2 repos you are merge and building a 3rd app 😆😆😆The app is laging so muchh...the text are overlapping and the gui is completely crashing.Why is there not a chronological timeline? What is wrong with all these social media companies that completely disregard that as an option?So far so good but one thing is missing Ability to download pictures on threadThnx Instragram team, for releasing new app! It's like a Twitter but I was thread by Instragram. Thnx Meta Family. This app very helpful for Aviation ✈️ related things. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The UI is very much organised and user friendly.The app looks nice but please add feature of saving a picture of full resolution like twitterUseless pale copy of Twitter without soul and no fun and tremendous use of data. Pointless.Absolutely wonderful interface. So happy for it. Bye bye Twitter 👋👋👋It's alright tho I would suggest to add a dark mode option because it burns my eyes out at nightApp is having a lot of issues Unable to navigate app Can't scroll through...it keeps blurringGood so far but there NEEDS to be a setting that lets me see only the posts of the accounts I follow, not just random ones. That's what twitter tried to do & everyone hates it so please add this asap please. What's the point of following someone of I can't see their posts.App is minimalist and good Keeps Crashing when i try to upload a picture, please fix this ASAP @zuckHow do I turn on dark mode? I use android. It cannot find the display setting to toggle on/off dark modeIt's a trap! Once you create a Threads profile, the only way to delete it is to also delete your Instagram account 😡For the day one, it's great. Waiting for hashtag and trending list.The upload image session always shut the app down if you click about the image to insert a caption...fixI was permanently suspended on twitter for no valid reason. So far, am very happy with every feature of this app.😊Great experience, great app. It's obviously going to take no time at all for this to blow up.Plz add location so i could see threads from the places i want . And in the specific language i want!I mean it’s a Twitter on cheesecakes instead of steroids — looks clean and simple, but I’m still testing it out. This is coming from a Twitter Blue user (pls don’t cancel me 🤡).Looks like a worthy competitor to Twitter. I've been enjoying the experience so far!Magical, I personally like the app. I'm synced on my account name @me_adams_ and gained more followers than I have on twitter for the past 3 years😂It's very great full for expressing our thoughts and feelings... really enjoying 😍❤️‍🔥#threadsGood currently. Please don't be hell hole Like Twitter in the future🥺. But translation doesn't there please 🥺 🙏work on that soon 🥰 .missing some features, but the best social media app i've ever used.pretty good so far but my only problem is there is no \"following\" and \"for you\" options in the feed.First time trying threads app basically just instagram based text or comments section, maybe the different between this app and twitter from the POV of user where at twitter users tend to hides their real name/username or alter account but it is different within this threads app automatically sync uname with instagramWell, I would like this except there is a bug and I can't do anything in the app. 🤷🏻‍♀️If only you can save the picture from Thread it will be perfect!There's only one thing left, dude. Mr. Zuck, hit us up with a DM, ya know? Saw a beautiful girl on this app, but can't seem to find no DM option.Interesting App, It's unfortunate I couldn't find where to upload images.Keeps closing, won't work on my phone, feedback part won't work eitherAmazing App Highly Recommend 🙃 just one complain Instagram Disable my account without any Reason.. Please Look at my account and reactive again it's requestPhoto video quality get decreased when you upload get fix after all this app is good long to goWhen I logged in using Instagram I'd it is saying something went wrong . App not opening errorRequire \"Bookmark\" option. And too much suggestions of not-followed users on feed.Thought it would be better than other social media sites but as like as twitter here you also can't edit your posts. it's too much pathetic for me.Good app, but still missing gallery/media tab on profiles then it'll be perfectHi there! Though the initial experience of finding my way through to Threads was exciting, I must say the drawback for me was that I can't add multiple accounts yet. Could you resolve that already please Threads Team?!It's not working in my device so many glitches while scrolling up and down. I want to join beta version of threadsGood app, good beginning...needs lot of improvement and I believe this app will emerge as one of the best app in social media world. Follow my threads account @kamriakhanamNice app. We want bookmark, our liked feed & not interested feature.Still loading! i think the app crashing because of high volume of a new usersSo far not bad, it can be great if you can add DMs & circles for the time being.It's cool apps , Similar of Twitter, But there are need to more software upgrades for better performance .This app is really good to use. I am very happy to see an app I can use other than the Blue Bird app.Changed my Instagram password after making a Threads account, and now, whenever I open Threads, it crashes.The app is topnotch, fast and reliable . Mark should kindly provide us with DM.It's fantastic I lost the words to say about it after looking into it big competition tweeter has now 😉I have been waiting for this from Facebook for a long time. I like it. It is very simple. Relatively easy to use.Amazing apl and a great replacement to twitter tho it needs some time in development cuz it lacks some featuresSuperrrr .....interesting features ..... good to implement more and more featuresApp is refreshing but I'm encountering crash whenever I try to thread on a thread.Nice experience but i think 🤔 you can add pictures save mode in you phone gallery like a Facebook...Just a replica of Twitter it looks as if they just copied the source code for Twitter and used that and basically nothing is differentLooks interesting but honestly looks like Instagram lite rather than Twitter's competition.This app looks promising. I hope this surpasses Twitter and follow certain limitations in terms of free speech and counteract misinformation and disinformation.The app is getting crash. I don't know why but it crashed please help meGood Twitter alternative, but at the moment the app crashes whenever I post HD imagesIt a very good alternative to twitter. But i have concerns about my data. Overall goodI get it it's a new apss but too much crash. Also please accept webm format video.I think I am the first to give feedback about the application, it is very cool and entertaining, I loved it 🫶🏻🩷Nice app, but there is one lacking. Please do include log-in for Facebook also.It's good but a few bugs here and there eg I keep copying text by mistakeOverall positive, just needs a private messaging feature.I only want to see posts from the accounts i follow. I'm interested in others posts. Add Following tab in Timeline.It's a good app but we want also want a personal chat system with known or unknown personNeeds a trending page and other forms of seeing what is currently happening around areas of the world being news and/or other forms of connectivityReviews are being deleted. Data and privacy issues. Major ones. Your information is not safe. Nor are your rights.Sucks up too much memory off of my phone. And it's choppy, not fluid way to use it.Fix the huge glitch please. The app is not usable since last night.My Instagram accounts is keep getting log out when I login to threads, & when I go login to Insta then my threads account gets logged out automatically please resolve thisI'm facing some problems suck as replying with gifs are not working properly. Hope it fix this soonThe UI and UX is awesome. They should add trends.Could really benefit from an Instagram like feed (people you follow first, then other suggested posts after).I don't know why but my thread app isn't giving me a clear view as I scroll up it begins to hang kindly rectify this...Nothing is visible properly the screen is glitching out check email for more informationThe app is great, but so far, I'm just having trouble with sometimes refreshing.So is this app available in the EU or not? Because I was able to download it and follow a bunch of pages just fine, but now it's just \"something went wrong\" all the time. What's up?The app is OK, just remember meta is scraping your phone to get everything it can sell.Stealing the Twitter concept doesn't make you creative, but a thife. Good job, Mark, for stealing.Great app almost similar to twitter. Lol i love the vibe with the app but why does it scramble when you try scrolling through posts?Unusable. The screen gets clogged and messed up.Good app for timepass and fun,but it same like Twitter just that one thing you need to notice.....Feels like the meshing together of Twitter and Instagram with a slick and smooth feel to itNice interface. Liked this. hopefully this will be something great.This app is very addictive 😍 personaly I don't like Twitter that much but this app is very engaging and me and my friends are enjoying this app a lot 😃 thanks for making this Instagram community 💙The issue with the app I am facing is it freezes when i upload a photo.I love this😍, no ads😍 yet but I'm sure they won't be long😞. Really easy to use 😎I want a direct messager like instagram and want to see trending like twitter and I want to able to download pics like twitter and I might be able to translate other language text introduce these feature as soon as possibleIts a great app, it filled with positivity. Definitely a great ideaThe home screen is just mixing up everything maybe a bug please fix itGood start but still needs so many features like Twitter if meta really wants to succeed.When i refresh the app, it glitches so i need to close the app and open it again to remove the glitchesIt should also show top trending. But overall it is excellent.I downloaded this app, set up my account, posted my first tweet and on the homepage, I witnessed tweets from people I do not follow. I deleted the app.🍏So beautiful 🍏I really love threads app 🍏. Just hoping for more features 📌 add up more features 📌 please 📍This app can be used by scammers. It should provide information on where the account profile is based like in Instagram. Again, please provide information on where the account is based.App malfunctioning on my phone. It glitches really really bad, please fix!Can't pick a new username. It's automatically the one from Instagram. Also this app has 4599 ratings and nobody bothered to write a comment? Guess you can buy anything these days.Underwhelming, not a replacement for twitter. Best thing I could say is garbage.Android version can't select album when posting image while iOS version can, what the...I don't have time for instagram, but I'd like to use this new app like my Twitter , unfortunately I have to delete it and stick to Twitter since I can't register without having instagram account 😢I deactivated my Threads account, still the threads badge is visible on my Insta profile. I \"hid\" the badge from profile section, but it keeps on coming back, why? I don't want to use Threads anymore. There should be a delete account feature for Threads. Since I've deactivated my account, the badge shouldn't be there at the first place!This thread is really good about looking at pictures and information what's in here but it's worth it. 👍The app is nice, but there is no option to send Dm and no trending hashtagsSo, you can't delete you account w/o also deleting your Instagram account and on top of that your feed is full of people that have nothing to do w your interest. Got it.I personally don't trust any of Zuckerberg's products in terms of security and others. Thank YouThis new app was awesome!!! The cool here is your acc is connected to Instagram!!! Not laggy and I literally enjoyed this Threads!!!When I video is muted, raising my phone volume should unmute the video.Nice I demand the ability to save images, and I also demand to search for topics such as Twitteralternative for twitter thats it their is no much new feature to attract the audience infact twitter is the best to develop you , this theards meant for time pass conversationsThe display is still glitch on Android, I can't even see what content is displayedToo much bugs and glitches.want to upload pic but there is no option here .I find this app way better than Twitter as all your accounts are linked, and is not dominanted by posts by mostly one person (Elon).Just downloaded the app (brand new) and I already like it, tbf I think it's better than Twitter but that's my opinion. I can't wait for the future work that will be put into this (future updates). *Definitely recommended!*Would be good to see a direct message option. Otherwise pretty pleased with this new Meta app.The app is fantastic but you can't get a permanent link for it, It keeps breakingApp full of bugs everytime open app crashes and closed not I am not recommended to use this appVery awesome app 💯💯...but i think it needs more features e.g sending direct messageI'm unable to login into threads because after I login on insta it logs me out of threads and the cycle continues.. please solve this outI like the app, but please please don't add the messaging feature the link to IG is enough 🙂There is glitch or bug in the app. My screen gets blur while using the appFirst attempt. It's good. Hopefully more updates in the future will strengthen the usability of this app.It won't let me create an account. You must have an Instagram account to join. A Facebook account isn't good enough.Great alternative to twitter. it's time to pull the blue bird down.Cannot use on browser only, dunno what they want to track with their native appSo far, it's pretty good. Just wish we could control what we see on our news feed. Noticing lots of people I'm not following.As I login the app there are so many glitches in the app and screen pixel got tear i can't even see the screenChoosing \"this was me\" while trying to login takes me to a page to change my password which makes no sense.Can't upload pictures; app crashes at every attempt.UI is not working in my mobile phone all text overlap each other plz solve this problemCould use some improvements but is super easy to set up and start using.99.999999% of the timeline are accounts I don't follow and no way to filter themApp is crashing...... Can't be scrolled.... The screen is bulring...Some kind of bugs and errors are seen in this app hope it will fix soonI can't even sign up here iñ Asia. It only have one option for singing up. No email, no google or no other optionsWorst privacy policy.. even you can not delete your own data from the account. If you create account and not like it you can not delete account and remove your data. The only way is they asked you to delete your Instagram account.Not working on my phone I have android 9 and the screen is flickering when scrollingIt's a good start....10M+ followers in less than 24 hours.........and need to improve lot of things.....hope you will improve as soon as possible ....application is smooth for operating and look feel is smooth Good work team Threads...When i try to post it shows \"your thread failed to upload\" but there is no specific reason why?App looks good. Congratulations to the Team. Great job done.Android mobiles can't able too access properly. It's blurred.simple and elegant but lacks important features like trending pageGood! Genius... I hope this app will continue to be developed. You can still see that while Twitter consumption is declining in this situation, Threads are gaining popularity.App is laging I opened one tab than so many tabs are being opend showing like server hacked so many linings what's the issues?You have to use same username that is on Instagram. I am already not happy with the username there and now I have to stick the same username with here so that is my major issue..I am happy to join Thread. It's simple and fantastic, it's better than some other social apps.In this app we don't have any choice to edit anything about profile! That's not good👎🏾It's second day of this application and it's working good....I think it is the best alternative to Twitter....It's a beautiful app but mine keep crashing everytime I wanna mention a username. Why?Still not in order. Much prefer seeing the newest posts first not what an algorithm thinks I want to see.Its going to be one of the best app after insta. May it will be competive to twitter... It may become an alternate for twiter in coming days.Needs more features and some tweaks but off to a good startWorst app , Zuckerberg is not going to do new things he only copying others and buying , he doesn't have the mind to create new things.aftet some time he will start taking 699 here for varified badges alsoVery bad App. Play Store please this app band very fast. This app is a trap App. Anyone don't trust this app🙏🏻🙏🏻😭😭Can't even change name of your account, until change it on insta.. No option for trends.. Overall Twitter is much betterTitle: A Game-Changer for Social Engagement - Instagram Thread App Review Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5) Review: Instagram Thread has undoubtedly transformed the way we connect and engage with others on social media. As an avid Instagram user, I am thrilled to share my experience with this remarkable new app. Instagram Thread takes the concept of storytelling to a whole new level, allowing users to dive deeper into conversations and share their thoughts in a more meaningful and organized way.Well, for a new app it's good. Just a few updates and it'll be an awesome alternative to Twitter.It's totally boring won't have option friends and also don't have opt of recent threadsOnly downside is seeing too many posts from people I don't follow so the ones I follow are getting a bit lost.Not better than Twitter at all, it's just an extension of Instagram that acts like Twitter.I like the app & concept. It still needs some work to do, but I love it!App is good but what is it's use didn't get is otherwise the app layout, UIis nice #elonmusk😭App is unstable. Its glitchy and bugged out when scrollingVery good! Is easy to use, you can express the comments. I like that!Best movie against musk 😂😂😂😂...but this app is totally incredible and Mark my words musk will still in coma after seeing such step from markFacing problem in running app... Automatically closing app and showing errorFound bugs alert !!! Its always crash when I check comments on my past threads.The app gets glitch and it's overlaps another content on newsfeed and gets stuckLike the app, just seems to be REALLY slow loading anything.The space feels peaceful and the usability is easy. Hope d twitter war.lords don't invade the space.This app is always glitching, should must support low-end devices as it's like on InstagramVery cool rn, but would like to see who I'm following on threads as well as topic searches opposed to profile only in the search sectionVERY GOOD APP. Please let there be language translator/translationThis application have more features,,,as compare to Twitter application.,, It's good and more flexible to use.This is great as long as no one on it is given in BlueTick for talent and not money.Everything's cool. I think you should just introduce the \"trending\" in your features99% of the content I see are from accounts that cross post the same empty platitudes, engagement bait, or junk news on every site. The rest are influencers who I nor anyone have ever heard of. I still see new posts by accounts I've blocked. This app is a ploy for Zuckerberg to take over the Fediverse, but currently it's complete garbage. This app will not cultivate a real culture in its current form. Even the influencers themselves are complaining. Draconian Meta content rules still apply.Samsung user can't upload photos app crashes every time!Takes so much time for post. When i want to edit e work the before and the after words bacome adjusted together 🫨🤥Can't get past the initial \"log in with insta\" page. Because I don't have insta presumably. I don't now and never will do insta so how do I join? Useless af.The app is buggy. It closes by itself when i try to open the repliesThis tried to be an alternative to Twitter and failed miserably. So many bugs on this appThis is very basic app yet... Not performing so well. Not expecting from a jiant company to produce this dull app.Nice UI, need a lot of feature improvement though.It's nice but we cant use two accounts at a time n by this insta is disabling lots of accountsEnjoying the app so much. However, please include: 1. Trending topics 2. DMs 3. Close Friends 4. Media/Gallery 5. Polls ThanksNo search option to search for post only for accounts, i see post from people i didnt follow.Amazing work 💪 done by Zuck Sir Team. let's celebrate 🎉🎊🎁 this today 🙂 Threads is like make of popcrone easy, fast ⚡, and tasty mean easy to use, fast signup&fetching and posting, tasty mean something new and creative which feel love to use .I opening the app touching to scroll there are something like bug it is not like a buge its actually buge checkout thisThe app is still currently glitching on my device and it's not even looking resolvable.Good 👍..But it is still in the beginning and needs more development and advantages, and it will outperform othersIt use to lag a lot... U can't even read properly due to this.. Looking for a good update nowThere are lot of glitches I can't even see the home screen. plz fix itApp requires a 2 step verification code to access. No such code appears. Already broken.... classic from Meta.It's good,but when you press home and it scrolls up your threads it's quite choppyWorst app UI and it is like sasta Twitter without any good features,even Koo is far better.Hello its an amazing app and well done meta but its lagging and crash when i try to post . Solve this issue ThanksAdd the save images or videos button to every post. Suggestion though 🙏We all know what's coming after a 5 star rating, for short, crazy app and fun place to be, thread lightly 😹Please add an option to change theme, it's always in dark mode.Still need improvement in UI,Features to competitive with others....The app is so glitchy that As soon as I scroll the app overlays every post over each other And they say that deleting this app will delete your accountAs expected, brilliant UI and simple to use, a big 👍So easy to use. Love that it connected straight to IG so no hassle sign up 👍👍Feels like browsing Twitter if I had Alzheimer's. No tags so you're shouting into a void. Can't find fanart easily. Feed littered with posts from people I have no clue who they are and I have nothing in common with.It's exceptional. I'd say more interesting than other Apps except Instagram...😍😍😍Terrible.you can't delete your account without deleting your entire Instagram account. It's a trap!So far so good, need to be added some features like DMs, pin post, etcKeeps freezing when scrolling up and down or changing tabs.\"Your Thread Failed To Upload\" cannot upload any image for some reason...pls fix this...When I open app it's start crashing and all picture stated mixed it upIt's not working well on my phone, its just overlapping whenever i try to scrollGraphics are glitching all over the place for my device. UnuseableI know, you're still developing the app. But, can I suggest to have a translation on it? I can't understand other languages.The app is awesome but it has one problem, we aren,t finding message buttonIt's glitching non stop for me. Developers, please fix this fast.My experience is very bad It's not working well and getting glitched every timeI'll adjust to 5 stars when I have Dark Mode lol. No complaints otherwise.Apparently, an Instagram account is needed to log in, which I don't have or want.Hey meta I'm I will give this app to 5 stars but in this app so many features are missing like trending feed , following people's posts,#,DM and many more please improve the app and user experienceThrede App Revive Request Threde app revive 5star I apologize, but I'm not familiar with an app called \"Threde\" that you mentioned. It's possible that the app is new or relatively unknown, or it may not exist at all. If you could provide more information about the app or clarify your request, I'll do my best to assist you.It's not working, I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling still not functioningIt shows many unrelated accounts to the timeline. I can not see the thread made by accounts I followExactly like Twitter.. Copy paste actually, I do not understand what this app offers more... I will stick with Twitter lolThe application is very beautiful but I am unable to publish the post as a instagtam story i I sent you the problem AlreadyShould also have an ability to save pictures just like on Twitter.Suddenly I cannot open the App, it says \"something went wrong\".I've humble request Pls Don't download it it's wastage of time.Having to much trouble due to lot of bugs.Great app. A new start to share your brand through thoughts and build an organic following. Everyone is a friend with everyone.The app crashes everytime I try to repost with caption.It is a good application, still I am using it, let's see what will be the benefit of running it on foot. 👍🏻👍🏻This app similar to Twitter but always good for Sir Mark Zuckerberg ❤️🫂 and more and more new features are update in threads app this is great sir and Mark Zuckerberg teams good work for opponent thank you!I started the app... My suggestion is when someone write in other language I can't read...there is no translationAnother new way to explore threads and posts, enough to feed me contents day to day.You need instagram to use this app - can't sign up to threads on its own - uninstalled straight awayAfter some future updates & improvements, I guess I we say that this will be a true Twitter killer just so we can let Vine get revived by Meta instead!By now collection and hashtags are unavailable in Threads. For me they are important.So far, so good. Still working up with the interface but kool👍🏿It's good so far. Just need to work on the home page because I'm not seeing anything there (it's blank)Great concept but continually crashes when I try to type or @ anyoneAmazing app actually I was sending request to Twitter so that they accept my confirmation email but yarrrr Instagram make it so easy for me now I can tweet easily I will recommend you too to go and download it💫💞Till the date i found this app great , user xperience is best and ui needs to be better at some place.When i open the app, it shows glitches. Please fix it.Interface is lacking and no way to find people.All screeps are overlapped Like it looks like when you superimposed multiple imagesLove the app, we need the translation feature brought from Instagram/FacebookThis app is trash. Twitter is the best free-speech platform. Okay, byee.Please help. I was using the app normally but now I only get \"sorry, something went wrong. Try again\" please fix it): I can't use anything in the app.After using this app my Instagram keep crashing again and again 😡 fix your bug 🪲great app than twitter where you can share text photos to your friends i love it Thanks InstagramI understand this is new but when I try to post my picture app get crashed i think you don't want normal people to post publicly you are promoting your own peopleThe app is good its almost like twitter Just implement the trending 📈 feature and add aome new other features that twitter lackNot working properly and glitching so much . Not able to workI just wish they made it so you could unhide/hide your threads badge if you wished.. but overall my experience has been goodContent loading needs work, otherwise a stable smooth app.I've logged in successfully but total glitch i happening i cant even use Please fix the bug ASAPi would give it 5 but it keeps on bugging so i'll just give it 4. it's easy to use but it's so frustrating coz it keeps on buggingVery nice app. But it doesn't function properly on my phone. It glitchesMy Home page full of news which i do not follows... it's like a rubbish bin dumped with news everywhere...My dp is not showing on.. and there is no option to adjust,,, plz make it correctThreads is the best social media ever. love it so much. hopefully they'll be lite version for threadsDefinitely a great app but we want a different things like dms ,shorts ,story i hope you make it tooDoesn't work. Can't log in using Instagram account despite what it said.Please add the translation feature. Thank you.Add a switch account option just like Instagram so that we can use multiple threads as we use our different InstagramsJust another congested news feed of paid nonsense from people and companies I don't care about. I want to see content from those I follow, and that's it. Don't worry, algorithm — I'll still buy dumb stuff I don't need; I just don't want my life to be a 24/7 assault of commercials.Everything is great but its batter if has save a picture feature.Keeps crashing on android galaxy s10+ and erasing cache doesn't do anythingNeedw a lot of work..the whole feed being taken up by people you've no interest in, or follow ia stupid. That's just the \"for you\" page like Twitter, which we all hate. And don't want.So much better than Tw*tter. So much less toxic and so much safer. You can be yourself on there and not have to worry about toxic people or the ruler E*on M*sk. It's so much better. I would recommend this app to everyone! It's THE best social media app we've had in YEARS!App has a bug that causes it to keep randomly crashing5 stars straight away! Meta is doing best in bringing the world together. Threads is one of the best apps that Meta has founded so far.Please add the feature to add multiple accounts, it's very needed!Instagram's text based social media application. No edit option for postNice , Meta has taken a very good step. It should introduce an option to save the image on Gallary ,Urdu language should be added to the app soon and DM options addLove this app.. Algorithm is too smooth. It's better than twitter with no doubtsI just wish that you can browse your folders when attaching a media.I would rate it a 5 if you could put the \"dark mode\" switch on it....it is literally same as twitter 🐦I'm enjoying this app so far. Great layout and a big plus of being less toxic than twitterGood app for rivalry Twitter. Kudos to the development team for smoothening the app. 👏👏👏The app is keeps crashing. I can't even see anything.Add the feature where users can share eachother threads, just like we share Instagram posts to eachother.People are creating memes. App is great 👍 but let's see how the algorithm works.Love about app simplicity. easy to use and fun! Meta did good job on thisCrashing always when i try to upload pictures or video with a threadkeep getting artifacts on the screen form previously opened sections of the appThis is a very awesome app, because we can add to our story our threads, i think this is better than TwitterPhoto doesn't upload whenever I try to upload.... everytime failed to upload Please solve thisLooks like far better than Twitter🫡 Mark Zuckerberg is jst doing some kind things for Instagram user👏 Expecting more features in coming versions🎉Kudos!There are just too many useless threads, which I am not interested in. Tried and uninstalled it.Can't even use the app because I keep getting an error message when trying to login.It was good...but from today the app isn't opening and crashing again and againWhen we open the app all screen all blur i don't not why this happened please fix thisI can't sign in, despite my IG password being correct, it says that it is not.The app is good , but every time I want to read replies it automatically closed : (I really love this app is fun to twitt and chart is lively infect is even more beter than the Twitter Everyone is happy extremely with this app Try this app is 100% funUnable to use the app. Screens are overlappingYou can only login with Instagram account and I don't have an ig account. Can't even login 🤦‍♂️LOVEEE ITTT!!!! Absolutely gorgeous!! 10/10 would DEFINITELY recommend!!! Bless you instagram!!!!It's not working. It's just stuck on it's logo whenever i open it . I haven't even login yetI’ve been on threads for 3 days and I still haven’t seen any aggressive political arguments, scams, bots, spam or abuse. If this continues, this platform will be huge.Nice app but don't involve Instagram app into this. If we combine both will start ignoring another oneLook like good this application I can use this app then some problems but next time upgrade then all problems are solved.Twitter after blender. What's the point in all this?Original Instagram is better.Nothing new.. just changing interface of insta.. n launched for making money only not entertaining..I uploaded the video when I played it and the voice didn't get deleted as expected from the brandNeed to add scroll bar and searching for posts and not just users.I couldn't open my account. It says try a few moments later and closes the app.Man I just saw a post from zuck and for some reason he wasn't blinking at all but there's this new app that he created and tom Brady and Jon jones are on it so I'm just going to be on it becuase I'm afraid of missing out.Such a worse experience with this app, What else can I expect from Meta 😂 Lot's of bugs and issues...It's too worst because when I started it, it started to shake screen And I was just seeing the blurr screenIt doesn't make sense that I have to delete my Instagram profile to delete my threads profile that's so unfair, and it absolutely doesn't make any sense. I'm gonna uninstall and go back to Twitter because at least I might have limited tweet views, but at least I'm not being held in a hostage situation on itEasy to manage very simple to sign in easy on my eye love it just want to see reach of my postsThis is horrible, Zuck. But what else would I expect if Facebook is the best you've got? Maybe it'll get better with time. For now, this is garbage.App's ui is good and easy to use but i gave 4 star because of @ and # feature not available or not working???all texts are placing up each other and make reading impossibleWhen scroll down its display bluring of all words no reading it's like..... Display break 😔App crashes on Android when trying to post a photograph.the app has been glitching ever since i installed it i cant see or read anything or use the app in any wayIt not proper working my location are in other places showing in my Instagram app.Tried to register but it won't let me. Ended up having to uninstall it. Waste of time.Amazing, bot free, I hope it continues to be so.Yeah good, but a very little bugs are there otherwise its amazing!!!Just wow guys expecting more updates and features make difference between Instagram and threads don't push same as Instagram keep rocking metaVery easy to use and very simple to mirror your Instagram followersLanguage translation not available.. Its should not be connected with Instagram..Everything is fine, but it would be better if the account could be opened separately.App is not working anymore I tried 7 to 8 times but it's still not working anymoreWorst app ever. They just deleted my fan account & there are so many other fan account which is still there. They just want to have monopoly on the internet. Worst app ever.Seems fun but the app crashes everytime I try to post a pictureAs I am new to the apps I have no experience but hopefully in the future this app will be great and we will be able to use this app very well.🔥🔥 Needs more improvement in Hastags sorting, activity algorithm, Threads sponsored ads , friends suggestions etc .. but good startHey there's a glitch everything just goes blurry and I can't even see anything please fix thisI think there is some bug on my thread. I can't use it. My thread is not working well. Thread is only hanghing.Bad experience!!! App saying \"Thread keep stopping\" Pls provide me email id so that i can send screenshotApp is simple to use and automatically joint with insta id .Clean off the jump. As a less than average Twitter user, I can see the appeal right away here. Will update review as necessary.It's kind of laggy as for now .. I hope they fix the bugs soon as wellNeed to make more user friendly. Trending suggestions (#) doesn't work.right now it's 1 star because it wont accept the 6 digit code that was sent. I feel like I'm just wasting my time to keep trying.NOT WORKING PROPERLY , SHOWING BLUR SCREEN , UNINSTALLED & INSTALLED SEVERAL TIMES STILL SHOWING BLUR SCREEN ONLY FOR THREAD APP . PLEASE RESOLVE SOONGood alternative of Twitter. This app feels smoother than the rival apps.I just want to try but u need a insta acc for that means double promotion I think k u should make that u can login by Google ;-;Couldn't use it at all it keeps crashing!!It's nice App, but you need to bring direct message feature please.Can't even use the app, i just scrolled and whole screen got messed.Its very buggy for lower power phones and not optimised well for lower androidsPlease hurry to finish the Threads program for the desktop, because it will be more beautiful to use on the computerGreat but UI could use some touching up, not aesthetic enoughThis application is good but there are no trending features, I hope it can be developed againIt's very cool App, it's the new generation Twitter I guess, very friendly to use, lolI hope they add stories and messages to it, honestly make threads its own app.One bad thing is that you can't delete your user account, if you do, your Instagram account will be deleted too And I hope that this problem will be solved in new updatesEverything u do/ change here effects our Instagram, we can't even delete it now it's like we r just stuck with itNot bad, actually quite good but would choose Twitter over Threads anytime.I hope a very good app can win everyone's heart like Facebook and Instagram. 😊😍The app doesn't work on Note 5 and keeps bleeping on the screen.Works good in my phone, no issues whatsoever. Better than Instagrameverytime i want to upload a photo, the app stopped working!The real reason why people are quitting Threads because it is literally boring. We have nothing to do on threads rather we prefer using Instagram.Mines Data. Even though they talked about data safety. Avoid.Great 🫶🏻 nd congratulations to Team Meta ,,,!!! One small query from my side ,, not seen any option to edit the post..!🤔Downloaded & delete within 48 hours... Nothing new features, just bored app.Threads is not working in my phone the screen is dragging a lotEntire home page is ads, companies and people i don't care about. Not a single person i follow appearswould be better if theres an optional page (following page, explore page)This is what I am talking about. Twitter became a cesspool of hate and misinformation. So happy to have something that feels like home interacting on without having to deal with nonstop hate and lies.I did not need this (another gimmicky social app) in my life. Waste of time and super buggy.. Staying on Twitter.Can't see anything, always crash. I wish I could post the screenshot here. I use Xiaomi Redmi Note 5.It's a great app, but it needs updates and optimization.Absolutely Amazing, it's like a golden egg for Instagram users !!!Was hoping for something like Twitter but it seems like Threads is great for advertisers and brands who have proiority over normal people. American commercialism and full of people saying the right things...Just cannot upload any photo with it.. always says failed to uploadI can't post or reply. Always same message, an error occured, try later■ Connect with friends ■ Control the conversation — Until there will be an option for the FRIENDS ONLY feed, my review will be left with 1 starVery Amazing app, it's free of ads, all ok. 👌🏻Please add (Stories & a messaging feature) overall app is great!This app is just like Twitter and working like this app has every single function like Twitter this app looks just like twitter if you like it then type yes in comment if you like bad I liked this app very much but there is no option to chat in this app, I request threads company to add chat option in this, do all of you also want to bring chat option in this appAdd save media feture and improve load speed. Wonderful appStarting great, very functional and fluid on day 1.Can't upload videos with photos lately!!! Buggy!!!!It is very good app from twitter But please add views like how many people can seen your post Otherwise it is the best appVery nice app, i am impressed with it very much and it's software optimisation.This app is glitching so bad I can't do or see anything on it, I hope it fixes soonWhy Threads when there is IG already? why not one app does all..? Like a Swiss tool. It's so cumbersome, since it's basically the same content.Worst app after i install this app my main account is not working.pls find a solution.i cant opn in instagram but i can open in browser...Technical issue : App still need more improvment am facing erorr right now as the posts keep showing erorr so please any help I need to share SSNice UI, seamless integration with IG. Nice job, Zuck!Glitch. Everything looks messy. Cannot even read anything.It's a good platform but you want to also add a hashtag features on itIt is amazing but you should also add translation in it.nice app but it need to add save post option and add save pictures to galary or download itNot optimized for phones with smaller screens.useless app. It wont curate your feed it just throws a ton of people who I don't follow on IG and they are all promoting their OFs or some stupid product. Don't get it, stick to Twitterapp not working display open when display shade more than three time app installed Android version 9+Interesting app and so much potential. Love that it links to your old Instagram profile. Meta should add cross sharing posts from insta to threads and also easy switching between your different Threading accounts eg personal profile and business profilesEasy to sign up, and follow people from Insta with a click.It's good but can it have option of translationNot working at all...app is crashing a lot can't see any postswhy my app is lagging, like if i scroll down the system will go crazy as if there is a glitch.Don't make it another Instagram, ban videos, limit pictures, let it be about writings and stuff.App keeps crashing whenever i try to upload a picture.Barebones so far too many posts I see from strangers I don't follow. But I see this might be a app people useYet one more stolen conceptby criminal Zuckerberg that is all hype and no content or value. Immediatey uses your private data without asking. Uninstalled trashWish there was an option to sign on or set up profile without Instagram.Very bad experience, poor, it can't be application powered by InstagramApp keeps hanging up, no update nor solution. No inbox/DM nor hashtagsI am using thread but there is a problem I received that this app was lagging to much I don't no why but I have problem from this😡so mark Zuckerberg please check this problem 👍thanks.......I like the app. I ditched Twitter because of Elon Musk so I like this alternative. Also, on Threads, I can decide who I follow and who follows me. So far so good.Am I first one to write review???? Good app... may become more user friendly interface after few updates!Really creative and ensures seamless communication.Good so far but my app crashes halfway through typing a post every timeDont automatically add instagtam followers please. Also If one worked for twitter it doesn't mean Elon owns you forever. Nice to see people have a choice.Can you also make threads lite? but it should be version 5.0+ btw i love this app 👍👀 we can use it for sharing photos videos and much more.Fix your app its glitching so much. I have reinstalled still not fixedThere is no inbox option. Performance is not good.So far it is like a skin for Twitter with the Instagram server but this runs well for a newly launched app.Idk why but the I am suffering from glitches whenever I am opening the app... It's not working properlyI would luv this app more if i could make my second account and message my friends on direct... We need some updatesIt is better if there is a translation feature in the interaction between all in the threads🤍⚜️ community من الأفضل ان تتواجد خاصية ترجمة في تفاعل بين جميع في مجتمع threads🤍⚜️July 6 Promising social app with some useful integration with Instagram and possible future utility with Mastodon.The App Is Quite Unstable The Text and Videos Are All In Glitch Mode While Scrolling Up or FownI feel some bug here.. I can't upload images.it's automatically going back.I don't use Instagram. So I won't be able to use Threads too? Very bad even worst decision making idea.It's not as good as Twitter every original has its cheap copy so thread is there..I hope Elon come with tweetbook and twitrgramSo whenever I am trying to see the replies on the things I have posted the app keeps crashingThe app is crashing i sent 1 star if the bug has been fix I'll change it to 5 starIt crashed when i try to upload photos Please it is tol early to suffer such set back.High quality pictures not uploadable cuz it crashes! Annoying 😭I have never been more disappointed with an application than I am with this one. It is an absolute disaster from start to finish. Where do I even begin?nice but what is the idea of the T-naming? Twitter, TikTok, Telegram, Threads. is there something you're not telling me?Just copy the Twitter concept with low UI and features quality as social media app.I can't seem to upload pics, app itself sutting down always!app can login with instagram but not with facebook and gmail it needs to be fixed . please Please 🙏Is not good actually. .. We want the option of watching reels and other videos, and need to upload videos option! ! @ like instagram. ..Just waste of time, no creative updates could add a value!Requires Instagram account. A new creepy way for Zuck and crew to harvest/sell your data.There is not any options to download a video or photo. but ok !When I swipe up all the images and text gets blurry and messyNot optimised, screen dragging while scrolling through the appBest yet. Would be nice to have bookmarks and markdown writing...bug alert! when i tried to scroll up all post are glitching i cant read it anymoreSpotted a bug in your new app if there is any reward system for giving bugs the tell meSo far the app is good. Expects to add more features in coming days.Exceptional extraordinary meta experience index over the hurtle and brightening my life.dis app is good but for those that have old phone versions should be considered. try making this app for all phone users whether old or new then i will give a 5 star reviewApp does not working properly, every time coming flash while scrolling down 🙃🙃Somuch bug first time opens and screen freezes and still no updateEven icon.🤣 3 minutes to make it. Surely Elon ll win in the box match. Theads is better then Twitter.Failed to upload multiple pictures in a thread.Not too good or different, just average and boring.So new kind of hard to figure it out. But I am sure it will get smoother in the next coming daysUpdates and upgrades are needed but so far it works well.Babe the app is majestic af but its crashing so fix it. Thank u😻😻Home feed full of verified people you don't follow or care about just like Twitter, except you can't even get a normal one like you can on Twitter. Shame, could've been the death of twitter finally but nope.Not letting me post any pictures and the app keeps crashing :(Everything is cool but if there was an option for massaging, it would have been funIf we could get trends, and video shouldn't play by it self then I'm ok.It's basically same as Twitter. Just waiting for something unique on this platform.I love the clean, fast, UI. So long Twitter. 🤮3 star for now, make a following only option, its kinda irritating because random people that i didnt follow appears on my feed 😕Can't remember the last time I got an app at launch and it was flawless. Bravo.Last 30 days consistent upload post but not viral. This is a new app Vary big problem 😕👉This is bad app.Only waste time here😂.Don't waste your time and don't use this app.If you always use in social media then, when you can do others important work in your life. 👈🧬👎👎👎It's good but you need to add translationthis app will have so many ads later on just like other META apps.Very nice, it has chemistry with instagram so thay i can easily share each other through these 2 applicationDoesn't work in Android 9 , Starts Glitching the screen .Its good because it's more usful than Twitter. There is a insta from threads thanks for Alon musk to build thse app.😘😘🥳So good easy to use. Can't wait for future updates including trends/ hashtags and much more. The best Part is you can post upto 500 characters ♥️overall it's good. but the app keeps closing when i tried to add more threadsThis is a very nice app but to competition with twitter this app needs a lot of work and improvement.It is so good and have so user friendly interface.I'm Uninstalling this app because Zuckerberg not following me back as app crash several times logo should be more professionalApp crashes upon trying to post content just another poorly executed copycat from zuck himselfwe need support for multiple accounts, login out every time I need to switch it's a little annoyingVery good but please donot limit the letters. It should unlimited.Garbanzo, looks like MySpace had a bastard with Twitter.

And showing content on each otherThe profile picture isn't uploading..please kindly check the matter..I am having problems with this app when I start the app it crashee in all aroundUI good and smooth, bug.. problem at total number like and repliesApp starts crashing when I upload any post Fix this bug Instagram.I think Elon will win the fight. The app is fine though, good UI/UX.When you want to copy text the app is crashed thats problem fix it ☝App is great and smooth also 😃 but give us download option for photos and videosIt's more peaceful than other platforms, so far. Hope it stays that way.So far so good, giving 4 stars because I don't know everything I can do on the app just yet. Still figuring it out.Something like Twitter, gives an enhanced feel and can add instagram followers same this platform..🤝Just a barrage of brands peddling the most saccharine trash possible. No way to get rid of it and just see who you're following.There is a problem with the video they are always mute 🔇 we have to change this situation to have voiceHaving an issue with this app very vety annoying (your thread failed to upload) I mean this particular issue Overall its okayPlease work on the sounds, there are no sounds for notification on Threads Also, we can't message privatelyWhen open threads screen are blinking and all post are not clearThere is a bug it starts to stuter when o scroll the page.Great App, but some time app stps working and show white screen, overall best app 📲There are no messages in the application, and also if someone deletes an account, they delete InstagramThis app is excellent. I am enjoying this app when I downloaded. It has 10 million downloaders right now.Text is shaking. Unable to read anything.It keeps on glitching it looks like a broken phone whenever I open the appits literally unusuable 💀💀💀 i cant open the app without everything freaking out and every screen glitch-slidingIts soo clean experience , but sharing data with third parties !!!I can't install Threads on my Computer. I was able to install it on my Smartphone, but I can't figure out how to use it.no way to get a thread noticed, like a hashtag or anything. so unless you are a Dlist celebrity, this app is turning into a waste of timeDoesn't get past the terms and conditions, just sits there loading.Good app better user interface than Twitter it's look like interesting the app is easy to useUpdate to include the hashtags so that post or the text reaches to large no of audience.Excellent app my first experience on that,so it is exceptional it great then twitterSuch a great functional app that Meta has ever done. I believe that Threads will be the next big thing in the future.It's kinda confusing at first, but once u get kinda used to it, it's gonna feel normal to u. 4/5 for me bc it kinda copies twitter idk.So many bugs while writing keep showing my keyboards not keys, Fix that issueIts okay but the app doesnt allowe explicit which is dumb because the app shouldnt be for kids or young teens in the first place.As soon as I select a picture to add post the app is closing immediately 😕Trying out the app. It's very new at this time, so who knows. So far it seems alright, there's content, a lot of big names are already using it. I've never used Twitter, so I don't know how it compares. I will state here, I've heard rumors that Threads will be actively censoring nazi content, and I'm here for that. Looking forward to nazi-free social media experienceIt's a great app and it does look like it could rival Twitter. I wonder what else would Zuck would do next to it....There is some glitch while opening replies section via push notification 😕 its not showingDon't like the recommendations. Would be appreciated if the recommendations can be turn off.I am not able to scroll in the notifications centre. Please fix thisI cannot search posts by tags like current trends. Twitter is now in business, political, media league... We all know Instagram and TikTok audience.Another copy and great way to steal our data. I can't even delete my account.Trash apps, don't use it cz its collecting your private information and its copy paste twitter nothing new.Great App Overall. Won't be long till it overtakes TwitterGod where are all these negative reviews coming from? The app is not even 3 days old. It's not going to have exactly what everyone wants. I think improvements and features will get better over time..The reviews where people are saying they can't sign up or it's difficult especially when they already have Instagram is laughable to me. It took me 1 minute..this needs a chronological feed free of algorithm-suggested posts or else I'm never gonna use it.The motto is \"say more\" .... But only in 480 letters. Really? Say more, but not much. Even in this app review I can write 500 letters. How I can describe my opinion in 480 letters? Increase it or byeKeep getting fail to upload have cleared cache but still not workingNeeds DogeCoin payment transaction! Everything else is almost an exact copy of the competition.When scrolling, the images and texts get confusedVery poor experience. Very chaotic timeline, sosososo worse than twitter 0.5 out of 10Really stinks. It wouldnt allow me to set up an account as I dont want Instagram.If u put dark mode and enable messaging and stories it will be the best social app everThis app is so much better than Facebook I would say. I think its just new app thats why this is kinda fun and good but after when this app got famous or something this will be worse Ikr. Anyways lets seeIt's an amazing app Simple and clean Hope the voice goes loud 📢Amazing, hopefully this is more better than twitter. Twitter is so much idiot things planned to their apps. Like limit post, suspended accounts, and the others.JFC SHOW THE LATEST NOT THE CURATEST. The app is good but stop assuming my news feed. Do betterNot working properly, all sections are getting disturbedThreads works fine like Twitter. Easy adding friends from Instagram.I don't have IG... So I can't log in? Please change this setting for thus who only want few apps. Thanks!Wth is wrong with this app??? It showing glitch pages .. it doesn't deserve even a single starNeed to make it so we can delete the app without deleting our Instagram accounts or you'll lose users/not gain them.This app is very cool nd its features is very easy to use nd name is osm(Threads). Now we will replying to anyone \" Main Use Threads Kr dunga\"Very competent but doesn't do well with the detailsWow this is very awesome app compare to all other app. I pray That like all apps in the Meta family, it should be number one in the world. From today I am a member of the meta family.Good app but it keeps crashing everytime I click something...Please give the option to see followers only posts as well bécause all I'm getting is posts from ramdom people and on the topic I'm not interested.This app is so premium and well polish, looking forward for some incremental updates..Hello Mark Zuckerberg, love your new app. Please do not include reels and messages in this application in futureI cannot post my photo in this app... I think there was a bug...Keeps crashing every time I try to attatch a photo.Since I didn't have a Grahm acct I had to make one I tried to use my portrait pic from Fb. But it won't sct it.Great start than making a monopoly, data should be stolen/sold from one place and that is facebook/meta server. Thank you zuck Bhai.Still need a lot of improvement can you upgrade apply a google translation/translationDoesn't have hashtags yet. But otherwise it's looking great!!It's a good app but no free speech. It sensors and removes almost everything including memes. Why would you sensor our opinions and want us to accept opinions which are against the basic truth? It's sickening 😒.Very good but need to improve more. I wish it should no be routine social site. Something new is expectedApp Doesn't work properly.. Showing some error please fix this problemWould be better if it didn't just randomly close while I try to post a status with a pictureThis app is very sweet and nice. The funny part of it is that it's easy to gain followersI can't login, it keeps showing '' an unknown network error has occurred''.When i log into threads, i get logged out of instagram. When i log into instagram, i get logged out of threads. Stuck in infinite loop.I rather see Instagram get separated from Facebook. Its still Facebook to me.You guys need to add trending tab and DMs and this app is perfect.Crash every time. When I open it and scrollThe apps is great! But why do i always force close when i click on Threads coment?It crashes. It is difficult to follow news.Would like to only see posts from people I follow. Otherwise it's just as messy as Twitter.This app make my display overlapping but its not fault in display!Please any bug in application, my device all text always move, thank youI can't even open a page properly I just installed it andbits glitchingI want to read stuff only from people I follow, not some random bs from random strangers.Worst app. Bad UI. unable to recommended. Bad work by Meta. It sucksUseless app don't even bother wasting your space and wifi with this bs!!!!Display overlaps with old, scrolling doesn't workApp keeps crashing and bugging at the home screenI have never used Twitter so I can't compare but man it is annoying that 90% of my thread is full of stuff I didn't ask to see.An app with an unique thought process, smartly developed..Just joined it but looks like nice and smoothly working AAP but still lot to done on this AAP.They should really add a feature to search for threads and also possibly add hashtagsKeeps crashing when I try to add an image to my post and at randomIt's good but add the dm option and group chat option.Much heavy bugs like I'm not able to scroll my follow request section in infinix note 11 please check this app again with you developersEASY TO UNDERSTAND UI. GOOD TO BE ON A NEW PLATFORM.I've just opened it and it doesn't work it gaves me like Screen tearing and I can't use it please fix itI don't see the point of this app. Like a boring version of the boring Facebook and Twitter appsCongratulations for putting out this app, and may the further development be in haste. Can't wait to see this app be built up.I like the app but when I'm threading it keeps closing before I can post.This app is amazing.To be honest, I don't use Twitter but when I tried this,I can't imagine how addicted I am right now 😂This is an awesome App and Definitely a good competition to the other app...Something like the app is Glitching or crashing in Dark mode ... Need dark mode update versionUnusable mess, literally cannot read/see anything because of a bugImplement the \"following-only\" feature then this app would be perfect.I actually love this better than twitter the only annoying thing is I've got a news feed of people I don't follow and I can't see anything from people I'm following.So far this app has been better and more enjoyable than I ever thought it would be. I'm excited to see how it evolves in the future.I don't think it's a new app I'm a Quality Assurance engineer software's I seem this app same as Twitter with different name n logo also there's a bug initIt's cool but same as Twitter,but there should be extra ordinary activity in threads....It looks like I can get Threads only if I already have Instagram? I've never had Insta and don't want it.I keep crashing while typing a thread and it's really long and now gonegetting force close attaching image, on a custom rom. android 11 aospI hope you never place ads on this platform. It's good as it is for now.Great app very easy to connect with your Instagram accountLacks alot of thing like themes ( contains a single theme ), you can't DM anyone , and etcdon't require instagram login. ur goal should be bringing stan twitter to ur app bc they're the biggest, most chronically online community. connecting to Instagram for signup is such a hassle*can't edit past posts (esp. wrong spelled words) *don't know why can't upload other pics (pic size?)Pointless app. Looks very much like Twitter without the engagement.I know it's still starting but after so much of advancements around the SOCIAL GIANTS we hope so express more!! Like we want more!! Ik we will get it btw the crowd here is cool 😎Everything thing is great but please add dark mode I am giving it 4 stars because of dark mode Else it is greatApp screen lag when I open.. Please fix this bugAs usual, no followers no use, no one using it in the feed, despite a seamless launch for onceKindly add features like spaces,hashtags and make search algorithm more clearlyThere is a bug if you activate your Insta account on thread than you are not able to delete your Insta storyGreat app so far. Simple. Just need to adjust few thingsm like right now we cant read other quotes replies .Worst app please don't download Instagram users you'll loose your Instagram account and can't use it properlyWould be great if it didn't throw up error message on my first attempt and wouldn't let me use it at allI think it's better than twitter but adding chatting option will be good for now.it's pretty fun & you can post whatever you want & follow your friends & keep up w them. : ) 20/10Early rating. Still a lot of work need to be done. Like the look of the app.It's high on ping... downloaded twice still the app is glitchingHard to find the people you follow as it just gives you hundreds of random posts.Great concept. Notifications not refreshing.no DMs, no hashtags, no feed in chronological order, no trending topics, buggy AF, and trying to delete threads profile will result in Instagram profile being nuked, pffffffFinally found an app that doesn't immediately go away from what it's meant to be 10/10Needs a lot of improvement...app crashes on my android..Ok so this thing is just like twitter but it's a mix between Instagram and Twitter Real impressive in my opinionIt's fantastic but it's not showing how much reach your post got like TwitterThe scroll is not that smooth. I have to work harder to scroll.Okay, I'm changing my rate. This app is addictive. I'm looking forward for the further development of this app.Tooo much good, but needs more features like double tap to likePlease fix bug, after finished image upload the app always Forced ClosedMy app glitches when I scroll, until I minimize then return to app. 😠Not working words are overlapped in the feed post.All features are best but i can't send message to new threads friends🥲Crashing every time I try to add a picture.Feels like using a cheap version of Twitter. If meta was so eager to Create something like Twitter then he should have tried to buy Twitter. Just feels bad with this app.It's simple because it's so new, but I'm liking it so far, and I can't wait to see what new features get added in the futureShould also add other like features like linkedin has (celebrate, love, laugh)While scrolling the entire app becomes glitchy. Can't even use itI can't post..when I'm trying to post..app automatically closed.😏Feed is cluttered with posts from accounts I don't follow and most likely have no intention of following.another meta app stealing data and private info even without option to opt out, its no replacement for Twitter, and should be bannedFrequent to crash everytime. Fix it!wasted many hours downloading this app yesterday. Once I went near Instagram my Threads information was not locatableit was good at first but as long as you use it often, it suspends both your Instagram and threads accountDear Sir / Mam I'm very very excited for this application. Even i can't enjoy like this application. Brilliant thanks for designed this application. thanks.The reason 3 stars because the needs or something, first it needs to have like a translator,𝟚 𝕕𝕒𝕪𝕤 𝕚𝕟, 𝕚𝕥𝕤 𝕡𝕣𝕖𝕥𝕥𝕪 𝕘𝕠𝕠𝕕, 𝕖𝕩𝕔𝕖𝕡𝕥 𝕒𝕦𝕕𝕚𝕠 𝕕𝕠𝕟𝕥 𝕨𝕠𝕣𝕜 𝕤𝕠𝕞𝕖𝕥𝕚𝕞𝕖𝕤& 𝕚𝕥 𝕨𝕒𝕤 𝕤𝕒𝕚𝕕 𝕥𝕙𝕒𝕥 𝕚𝕟𝕤𝕥𝕒 𝕗𝕠𝕝𝕝𝕠𝕨𝕖𝕣𝕤 𝕨𝕚𝕝𝕝 𝕒𝕝𝕤𝕠 𝕣𝕖𝕗𝕝𝕖𝕔𝕥 & 𝕓𝕖 𝕗𝕠𝕝𝕝𝕠𝕨𝕖𝕣𝕤 𝕠𝕟 𝕥𝕙𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕕𝕤 𝕓𝕦𝕥 𝕥𝕙𝕒𝕥𝕤 𝕟𝕠𝕥 𝕤𝕠,𝕀 𝕕𝕚𝕕𝕟𝕥 𝕗𝕖𝕖𝕝 𝕝𝕚𝕜𝕖 𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕣𝕥𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕗𝕣𝕠𝕞 𝕤𝕔𝕣𝕒𝕥𝕔𝕙🙄 𝕒𝕝𝕥𝕙𝕠𝕦𝕘𝕙 𝕠𝕟 𝕦𝕟𝕤𝕥𝕒 𝕚 𝕙𝕒𝕧 𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕩 𝕠𝕗 \"𝕗𝕣𝕖𝕖 𝕡𝕒𝕣𝕜𝕖𝕣𝕤\" 𝕧𝕚𝕖𝕨 𝕓𝕦𝕥 𝕤𝕒𝕪 𝕠𝕣 𝕝𝕚𝕜𝕖 𝕟𝕠𝕥𝕙𝕚𝕟𝕘, so✔️👊A new social media app yet you can't even do a hashtag? A one simple thing that all of socmed has even Facebook and Instagram yet there's none in Threads. Like what?The app is incredible..but I have a problem because i can't see my followers and those following meLots of Bugs. Firstly, No dark Mode Secondly, no edit option of pic while posting. etc.No widgets? Really? Have a scrollable full screen widget.I am having some issues,like I can't scroll the page....it is like some bugs I feel....Whenever I want to read something on it and reply to it, this app closes and says there is a bug in this app?I can't find follow requests sent to me in the ❤ section. It was there but than disappeared? I am very disappointed with itvery useful till now. the only thing i miss here till now is saving photo.. please add this optionThis app is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE on my Xiaomi Redmi note 7. Hope a fix is coming soon.Unable to use Instagram, after download of this app Instagram was not working in my mobileContinuously Force closes when trying to upload posts.This app is the best app ever... Kudos to you Mark but the app needs to have DM and Verification requirementsVery good this app but this app in privacy seen for example location photo etc. 😆😆The app is randomly crashing when attaching a photoSo much spam. I go to a popular post and 70% of the replies are people saying to do 'x' for $5,000 or proving links. It's a ton of spam and bots at the moment. Makes me sadly go back to Twitter for now.I have noticed some bug on this App...... Clear the bug I have to review it.....WHY IS THERE NO HASHTAG SYSTEM ON THREADS? IT'S SO HARD TO LOOK FOR MESSAGES WITH SPECIFIC WORDS THAT I WANT TO SEARCH FOR BECAUSE THERE IS NO SPECIFIC \"HASHTAG\" SYSTEM. I HOPE THREADS CAN IMPLEMENT A HASHTAG SYSTEM ASAP.Tried to change my username through Instagram after I was done the app didn't work again.The app is good but if we can message each other it will be much fun to useGreat but needs a trending tab, and a sfw feature. It is not sfw.uploading picture caused the app closed immediately, fix itAllow us to use multiple accounts at a time like \"switch account\" and also add a \"like section\" where we can see what we like or how many post we have liked.It's glitching way too Much plz fix this app or update it as soon as possibleBRO..THIS APP CRASHES A LOTT..I MEAN..AS SOON AS I OPEN THE APP..IDK WHAT HAPPENES..EBERY BUTTON OR TEXT OR IMAHE START OVERLAPPING EACH OTHER OR SOMETHING..IDK BUT THIS JS HAPPENING WITH MOST OF US..FIXX IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE..WE CAN'T DO A SINGLE TASK WITH THIS GLITCH..I WANNA CHECK THE APP AND ITS FEATURES..BUT THIS SRUPID GLITCH IN FRONT APPERS AND DOESN'T ENDApp crashes while attching pics. Fix this pls.Please add “follows you” behind their username so users can easily distinguished who are their mutuals.Great app everything but there shoud be an option where we can message other userslaggy, can't even scrool without letters overlapping, can't read anythingNot an independent social media. All related to Instagram. Even account is created with Instagram details. Can't deactivate account without deactivating InstagramExcessive amount of data it requests and also shares with 3rd parties. Copy cat of twitter. What happened to Facebook I wonder.Great app. Please add feature to search stocks by $SPY etcIt's crashing every 5 minutes. What kind of behaviour is this Mark 💀so clean! i love how minimal the monochromic color pallete that was used.Anythime I try to add a picture, it keeps exiting the app.It's just a poor man's Twitter or a what Instagram would be like without pictures 😭Worst app all are uploading same content in Instagram and threads why can we watch same content in 2 apps ?We're 100% happy for this beautiful work 😩😂 Freedom at last 🌝🤝 Looking forward for great and amazing updates 😌Seema really biggy and broken right now. Will update if they fix it but right now, not really there .UI looks interesting. Missing #trends option.Installed this app and it's full of glitch. Don't know what to do and how to fix this.The app crashes every time I try to open a threadNot at all optimised for some low end devices. Very disappointedVery shady privacy practices. Can't even delete your account without also deleting your Instagram account.I accidentally remove the threads badge on my instagram profile and there's no way to recover it back :-( Can you please solve this problems \"hide badge\" thingy. Can you please put or add \"unhide badge\" on instagram so that I can really enjoy this app.Clean, fast, straightforward. Everything that made Twitter fun before ElonSign up at other communities with Lemmy. You don't have to give your info to Meta. This is their scummy attempt to steal your data as part of the fediverse. You have alternatives which don't attempt to scrape your phone.Where is the download option on photos and videos? #twitter holds the features😛🤸‍♂️🤸‍♂️Good one. A good chase to the bird... Keep shining, good luck.This app is great so far for me it's better than stupid twitter the ui is nice there's little to no bots you don't get any of the dumb people so far and they actually take moderation so far a little better than twitter actually allowing things instead of saying existing broke guidelines garbageI would like translation of the comments and posts.. ! Would be wonderful, thanks !I request to all team of threads that please don't give a option of reels and any video.Shows following once and then immediately switches to complete strangers. Worse than twitterI can't see text and when i see some text double when i scrollSo far the app is nice ...u gat ma five stars .... Its interesting ❣ But at least limit on the restrictions time 😤Nice 👍 looking forward to see what they add. 1st time experience was good 😊An excellent start but there are thing to improve like add tranding pageThe app crashes when creating a thread with pictures.It's great but it's left with a trending chartBest but need to edit option when photos uploaded with captionsGreat app, but it needs dm's and a save feature.Awful experience it just lag every second you touch the screenHello, Everything is excellent but I'm unable to find Trending pageapp doesn't work properly, it keep crashSo far so good, just one quick question, in months to come will this app offer useful tool to people looking to be content creators influencers etc ?App is glitching at the first time itself i installed should clear the bugVery bad...no option to show us what's trending like Twitter. Not use hashtags.The screen is flickering inside the app what to do ?Please solve this issueGathers a ton of unnecessary data + can't delete account without deleting your insta account.When i start use this app my instagram crashed and i cant go to the home page anymore, now im using instagram lite because this bug, anyone facing the same thing?Great alternative to apps like Twitter. I actually enjoy it way more.. somehow differentSo bad , I didn't like it at all + please either delete the whole existence of this app or make some good updates ASAP!Continually crashes when trying to post photosIts Good..... It is minimalistic and simple yet very pleasingthe app seems pretty great but it stops every 2 mins or soFeed not works here, the screen is stretching, no usableIt glitches alot!! Can't see anything. Worst experience.It's a good start but they have to add some thing before it can be great: 1. They need to add an option to see only people you follow instead of an annoying algorithm. 2. They need to let you mute all posts from languages you don't want or not know. 3. They also need to add option to change the name without changing the Instagram name. 4. Another useful think would be the ability to zoom on an image and staying zoomed without it snapping back to normal size. 5. They need a website.It's probably the newest comment To the future, uninstall Instagram it's addictive quit ciggerate call 911 life is meaningless joy till tomorrow, cause you have to go to work Search new job exams are over don't know if will pass FMApp often crashes when in the middle of writing a post losing whatever you wroteThe cookie is still in the oven, but you're impatient and want it now. Cons: Videos not playing after unmuting. No hashtags. Feed is too random and crowded. Needs a following tab. Lots of \"account growth\" spam. No alt text. Pros: Blocking, and muting does the job. UI is clean. Harassment is manageable. Not owned by Elon. It's not Twitter.Really threads with the app not showing clear result on Nokia 8Not too bad. But please add the ability to ONLY see the accounts you follow. Thanks.Garbage copy of Twitter. It's basically twitter but way worse. Personally, I don't like copycats and this is why threads Has already failed.Good app, kinda better than Twitter, but can't post videos. ZUCK PLEASE FIX THISThey are many problems in app not support gif And trending is not available Not suitable for new userApp is not working properly we cannot even open the appNice new App could do with alot more features but i think it will get thereShowing glitch...i uninstalled and installed again but its still the same...I can't upload photos. When I upload photo, the app closed😔Need more features and better data collection policies.I really love this... At least there's another room for opportunity... Twitter ads are cost . And getting engagement could be difficult.... But welcome THREAD....I like the design ngl. I had trouble with twitter, I hope thread can fulfil that.This app need an update, I can't send direct message...🤗🤔Worst app with lot of screen flickering and very slowI don't know why. But everytime I open the app, it crashesit is a problem bug. And black crash screenrendering too many times whole ui is fluctuating.It's a good social media platform this app may be helpful & easy to work it.Just a bloody copy of twitter, It's the exact same thing but worse, Wouldn't recommend supporting these kind of clone appsSo far enjoyed so much. hoping for more new features. its like tweeting with instagram✨What is this?? If i don't have an Instagram account i can not login to Threads?? Why??? Just accept that we need a less toxic app than insta that's the reason we stayed on twt all this time. And now Threads won't let you login without insta account?? Thats not at all fairThis is a good app and nice competition to it has very good potential to growIntresting ui,no bugs easy to understandand easy to interact with our community faster Good effort by team @instagram @meta @zuckNeed more like downloading pics, dark mode, sharing post with other social media.App keeps crashing, hoping for a fix asap :)A lot better than Twitter. But it would be better if you didn't have to log in with InstagramNice interface, Hope doesn't change your mind in interface in other update .🙂It always crack when I start scrolling the screen.Very good experience and UI is outstanding.as boring as twitter, if you create a new social media app, make your algorithm fix first and make all your user have a better number of views and likesAdd more features plsss. Like edit button, and etc..you need an account from a different app for this app. that makes no sense. also the website doesn't do anything.app closes whenever I try to post a photo. Please fix it.It started out great, but now I cannot even post my threads anymore, the app refuses to upload my threads🥺 I'm going back to twitter now😪Crashes everytime I try to attach a photo.Good app but needs to add further features, in the comparison twitter is better 🔥Its good smooth but should have to add module for edit postCrashes every time I try and leave a comment, so frustrating to useThreads batch remove instagram then not a 2nd time not appicable this not good aap please this option able to threadsVery disgusting app.... Don't compare it with Twitter . Twitter is much better than threads.very useless app.Dont waste ur data in download this app.Instagram integration need to be upgrade When I clicked \"show in threads\" is not directing to threadsWhy is it that when I post a video, the sound does not appear with the video?The insterface is buggy when i scroll the page its reallyyy buggy please fix it...When I open the threads I share the app crash, every single timeMy app keeps crashing when I clicked the reply.APP LOOK GOODS BUT HOW CAN WE SWITCH ACCOUNT LIKE INSTAGRAM BECAUSE WHEN I SWITCH MY ACCOUNTS THEN EVERY TIME I HAVE TO START FROM WRITING NAME AND BIO OR COPY FROM INSTAGRAM. CAN YOU FIX IT THIS PROBLEM MAKE ACCOUNT SWITCH LIKE INSTAGRAM.Great app, however the translation feature is missingIts is too amazing app by meta to promote conversation its a very good app just go for it..It's good overall 👍 But Can you add the translate option So we can understand others language threadsApp is not properly working.... It lagging the screenApp is getting crashed while uploading the specific images.Good app with better ui than twitter...though twitter is more maimstream app and it will be more authentic like it was...Very easy to use better than twitter you can share with any one and you log in with your instagram you open the app and you see your account on instagram you click it and you just log in and when you open on you instagram profile you see threads picture and anumber behind it the number is your turn of installing threads easist and best app in 2023Still missing some features. Hopefully they'll come soon.I don't like the app because its not working in my mobile.My instagram is also just loading,my instagram is not openingNeeds improvement : We need DM, threads topics, gifs rn and more interaction w/ Instagram!It has a lot bug. Not working properlyIt hangs a lot , this is not what i expect. I think the developers should look into this issueApp is crashing as soon as I try to operate with flashlights effect 🥴I hope you will close this thread app very soon i have no idea why are we using this app, only Instagram is better then this useless appuseless, can't even change name or username other than Instagram.Good, just needs a following feed and a home feed. That'll boost it to 5 starsI'm finding it hard,even with the correct login detailsNo hashtags, the app keeps stopping when I try to upload imagesI love it so much easy to use and connected to Instagram perfect ♡Every positive review you see that only says \"Great app! 5 stars!\" Or \"Love it\" etc is actually just a paid for bot account out of China or India. Zuckerbucks is a tool and buys and sells your data with every facebook/Instagram/threads profile you use. Just....don't. Wake up people!Feedback on current version 1)You should provide story option for this app 2)when we do search , no resultsLacks a trending page but otherwise a smooth & likeable app so farIt's great, only one setting is needed for the dark and light theme because lower Android 7 and 8 don't have this feature.When i open friends profile the app keeps crashing please fix itIt's not working properly it us showing multiscreen .Very good app but one problem not story added 😕 please next update on story option 👍we want zuckerberg to make a seperate dm for threads , trending stories for local location and worldwide and an edit button.Very great app its much cleaner than insta in terms of designWow, I'm so excited about this app. It's obvious that a lot of work , thoughts , expertise has been put into creating this app. This app is going to rock the world. Thank you Meta.Lacks basic features. No trending topics etcOnly thing I’m loving about the thread app is no messaging feature. Only threads. Keep it simple please 🤌I have already deleted this app for 3 times just for glitch! You guys should solve this problen ASAP!Consuming more time !!😑 Not user friendly UIAmazing!!! I want to be a part of Threads and help improve this app!Flashes a black screen and then closes instantlyLove it! One thing that I would want in the app is direct messagingUnable to log in after logging out to switch account.Will this app beat Twitter?? Joke of the century !! worst site wrost performance wrost experience. I will surely go with 0 star ! And Uninstalling the appnever got rate limited on Twitter cuz i couldn't stand the app for more than 2 tweetsit would be great if you'd allow us to make more than 1 thread account like you have allowed us to make more than 1 insta account all on the same app....Crashes constantly when trying to upload imagesI think it's linked with a an app called *'Sure Fixed Matches'*A copycat of Twitter. Great that it helps to filter & clean Twitter's environment from those that're not belong to Twitter💁🏻‍♀️App crashes when trying to upload any pictures.Logo is more like Strip than thread . Thread is thin . You see strips going around at landing or opening of the app .Nice sleek app, like it's competitor but with a better user experienceThis is best but . I couldn't give 5 star because ( I want to post on thread so I have to search many more Therefore I hope that this error will fix)Well something Interesting after a long time for starters it is basically Instagram with some add on'sAll the good parts without a lot of the bad partsJust crashes sometimes otherwise it's a good fun app to kill timeNo switch option for multiple accounts and direct massage.This app is good but here no option to \"PHOTOS\"🖼️ save in gallery.Unfortunately i remove my badge because i didn't know that time how it works but now i wanted it back Please do something for that i really wanted it back!Great start! Needs improvement but I feel great about what I've seen so far!Need some important in animation section and also need save image optionThank GOD thatbother app was just focused on propaganda...i hope there is a fact checker here. Looking forward to this!I installed that day when it launched. It's similarly Twitter and attractive app and totally niceThe app is smooth to use can't wait for more features !No issues so far, doesn't look the best but it works fine.Amazing app but there's always room for improvement and developmentIt's a second rate twitter basically looks to be a rush job to take on twitterHalf polished knock off app, doesn't really add any value over competitorsWant to see what its all about but app keeps force closing when I'm typing something for some reason?!I don't use Instagram,i deactivate my profile!!! Why can't I use threads separately! Atleast give an option 😒Keeps on closing... Please fix can't make a post wellAm I suppose to have Instagram to access this app ? This is nonsense, I don't like Instagram and I won't install it to use another app , nothing good comes from this all he thinks about is making more moneyIt keeps crashing the moment I open it I go back to my home screenApp is not working correctly it blurs all posts and lettersNice app just I want dark mode option data saver option and once time threads edit optionIt's a good app But it should have trends to make it better and data saving optionNice attempt on copying Twitter but I find some things not so comfortable in this app. For example, I can't separate posts in a feed between recommendations and my follows. It's just a huge list of endless publications from people I don't know and don't care about. Also it would be great to have \"save media\" button.Desperately needs a \"following only\" feed. This sucks so bad without one.No volume, everything keeps glitching, Twitter is better.Well....it a good app but can you pls allow messaging on it instead of going to InstagramWon't like me sign up, can't create a account, it is not simple to use it, 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎Automatically closes the app while adding attachment.Nice UI, no reason to switch to twitter again.Clean design, and finally textual content amidst the proliferation of video contentA great alternative to the overly toxic and growing misinformation hub twitter has become. Contact migration was seamless.App is not running well...and screen is like hazzy🥴🥴The app takes me back to the playstore when I try to add an image to my post.This is a fun app, but I want a page to show what only the people I follow post.The app is glitching, I reinstalled it multiple times but still the sameNobody engages with your posts on this app and you are not able to delete your profile. No longer interested in using this app.Where's the dark mode? It's really useful, it should have it as an option at leastI'm all for sticking it to Elon. Can't wait until new features are added.The app defitoo addictive ❤️✌️ Thanks To Mark for this.... But would really appreciate if we could send DM's itA few minutes in and I'm already loving it. Can't wait to see how this will rival the bird app.Super app and instagram is very very good what will be very good threads now and there is no better app than this i do it a lot thank you Instagram ❤️☄️🎶🎧💌🌍🤞🏻When you open your thread number on your Instagram you can't get it back so they need to fix thatJust a cheap copy of Twitter, man they even copied the blue check.Need option for downloading images. That would be great.It's hard to find anything interesting... all just stars, and I don't care about them.I am currently liking this app because I am from India and I follow a lot of content creators on Instagram but on DMing them They don't reply but at present in this application if you reply to them they also reply 😂😂Followers are crazy, isn't it Babu Bhaiya. 🥱IT'S LIKE TWITTER BUT MORE CENSOR AND MORE SAFE AND LESS ADS . ITS JUST BETTEREnjoying the thread based communication, however experienced lessened by frequent crashesThis is a very good application. Will there be any monetization tools on this tooThe app crashes when I try to open from this morning.I don't need separate/additional app just to share my ideas or minds, there's already TwitterA pretty Good app but looks very similar to Twitter and has an UX of Instagram 😂😂A very good start, really enjoying the app. let's see how it goes !App keeps crashing when I try to post smthng! FIX ITTTTTT!Pretty smooth so far. Easy IG integration.𝑻𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒂𝒑𝒑 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝑻𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆'𝒔 𝒏𝒐 𝒂𝒅𝒔 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒊𝒕𝒔 𝒄𝒐𝒐𝒍 𝒕𝒐 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌 𝒂𝒕 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒅𝒐 𝒊𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒌 𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒚𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒊𝒏𝒔𝒕𝒂... 𝑳𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒔𝒐 𝒎𝒖𝒄𝒉🥰🥰I like how it works. I feel like hiding who follows me and who I follow would be nice along with a pinned post feature and dmsEvery time I try uploading a picture the app crashesFirstly I want to say that this Platform is too much Useful and Advance with all the new features and I Love meta ❤️Amazing app, just like twitter but without any of the downsides, so happy meta has finally come out with this appNeeds some tweaks but it's way more acceptable than that mess Elon made of Twitter.App keeps on crashing when i try to attach a pictureAll is delicates in all screens, this problem just on the android phonesGood app but will be better if you add a messaging featureThe UI is simple and faster.Great App , Just Add Save button for pics and videosit's great to have a twitter alternative but scummy that they don't promote newsInstalled. Opened. Saw random content by people I don't even follow. Closed. Uninstalled.not have a translation language compare to the main ig app🙁👎👎Loveing the app! Haven't used the app enough to provide the full review but will update this asap!I'm no bot. App is horrible. And as I heard, I posted right away and was censored, everyone was right.When I scroll down, the screen starts flickeringWorst app like Instagram meta they are always against freedom of speech and expression. 👎loving it so far, but am yet to find trending topics and hashtagsBeen great so far Just lacking a trend section and a direct messageApp is glitch, everything is mashed up together. UnusableThe app is good but instgram shall provide an option to delete the threads profile without deleting the instgram account.There is bug ... Like unlike ... Automatic and thread posting failedIt's f**king insane. Btw better then twitter but it doesn't have features like vote and many others like twitter have, and we need it here too.Very cool app, I left twitter, I love how it's fun and family friendly. LETS GOOI would like them to show only my followings in my feed or related to my interests rather than a total bunch of unknowns...Just another tool to collect more data from you.It doesn't supports scrolling... It feels like my mobile phone is hacked even on a single scroll 📜App seems to be riddled with bugs. Not a good experienceI will be happy to give Threads another star when you enable a translate function on individual posts.It's easy to use, but I wish this app could be linked to our Facebook account.Faced glich on dark mode but it’s good on default.Cant even open the apps.. keep force close when i clicked the iconUnable to use the app error in display feeds from redmi note 7 proI really say Instagram is better than this app we can't watch any reels on this appIts always saying that you have been logged out of %1$s the account owner may have changed the password And I didn't change the passwordEasy interface and lightweight, Looks promisingExcellent app. But please make a lite version too.its not working well the fonts get crossed and i can't see anythingThe app keeps glitching. I literally cannot even scrollCan't replace twitter, tried this app not can'þ delete the account without deleting the insta accountVery good app for news and writing contentGood app just need to fix some bugs and add trending pageThe app is good and is working perfectly but I didn't gave 5 stars because zuck copied from Twitter 💀I think I can't add another account in this app. I hope it will be added as soon as possible.This app makes more background requests than TikTok does. Yikes.Trendy and connect people easily and fasterThe app is not working properly, it is fluctuatingYou can't delete your account without deleting Instagram.. You can't even change the name 🤦🏻‍♀️The app crashes everytime I upload a media.The app is really cool.

Error message. Keeps saying owner probally changed password! I havn't changed $hT 😭😂Twitter is better, auto translater also not available.Good but should have a following and a dark mode.I want to block people in threads but it turns out that Instagram is also blocked, why isn't it separated????App crashes whenever I try to post some photosBrilliant app! So pleased to finally have an alternative to the garbage fire that Twitter has become 😃The only thing I don't like so far is the fact that we can see people we do follow reply to people we don't and theirs no option to turn it offAdd a one facilities we can see the profile pic in thread also and u have to update more by design and add something interesting i can't see reply of my post 😐Crashing frequently when uploading photos.Works well!

Expected to get this feature soon....Please update this app After opening screen wos blurred and unclear Many bug to fix your in your appI'm unable to download this app it's just show can't be installed try again 😕The app is taking too much time to get installed. Loosing the hype somewhereCan't log in without Instagram account. Not interested, bye...This app is so good to use,but the problem is that there rest no way to save picture🤨When I login thread I Got logout from Instagram automatically 😂 and when I login insta again, then I got logout from thread ,If you hide your badge you can't restore it This is stupid, please fix it Other than that, the app is amaZingI really like the theme of it.....lets wait and see how well it compares to twitterWe need; 1) Easier method to switch between accounts, just like Instagram. 2) A way to filter the threads we see. We should have the option to only see Threads from the people we follow.It crashed 5 times in just 1 hour today... Please fix thisKeeps crashing when I try to post a picture with a captionApp doesn't work properly.... It's lagging heavily....The app is glitching on my phone yet my phone is compatible can someone please help me outdisappointed app ask me to download it from Appstore when sharing images but guess what 🙂 I am using android and downloaded it from play storeIt has lot bugs and it is lagging and it should be fix right nowIt's very good but u have to add text with authorsIt doesn't run ... Get crashed everytime i try to use itIdk why but the whole screen starts Glitching when I open the appMake a way to uninstall this app without losing Instagram data very soon.Use Interface Be a little more careful Best Experience App Very Very 👍🏻Such A great app you can use literally today i got access to this and got addicted till now this message I have written I literally post 15+ threads in this app ..Is like any \"Meta\" products, wasting ur time, making money from u. And yes I still prefer (Twitter) because it keeps me away from all the junk opinions. I'm not a follower 🐑I am seeing too many celebs posts and not enough of my followers and friends. Not sure if that is normal life.Some glitch in it. Not working properly.The app Is Great but please I think you guys should add a message optionI need more insight, still new at this ... I need to understand how to link up all my IG profiles to THREADS, would appreciate some genuine guidance.Need share option directly to friends like Instagram sharing option 😁My app just crashed its keeps on saying there was a problem try againThis app is a copy of Tweeter, actually tweeter is better than Threads and Koo is better than tweeter.Post failed, when ever I tried to comment under people's post it we throw error (post failed) that's the only reason am not okay with the appTotally copied from twitter. Useless application and algorithm.Have a little scroll freezing problem on 2GB RAM devicesजब हम किसी की पोस्ट पर रिप्लाई करते है उस समय दिखाई नही देता कि हमने क्या लिखा और जो लिखा वो सही भी है या नही, रिप्लाई के समय key board ऊपर रहता है और जिसकी पोस्ट का रिप्लाई करते है key board के नीचे रहता है DM ओर मेसेज सुविधा नही है When we reply to someone's post, it is not visible that what we wrote and what we wrote is correct or not, at the time of reply the key board remains above and whose post we reply to is below the key board.There is no DM or message facility.App is not working properly it is stuck in The middleThis app is having glitch it does not load so not a fan of it still wishing let's seeWonderful app with good and simple interfaceNot properly working... Showing glitch on screen... Poor applFlickering screen and Full of bug.Threads App doesn't have a Message icon mthewwww more like Twitter but no way to send direct message 😓😓Bad optimisation when I am scroll the content everything is start sacking and over lapingserver crashed again its like i am not connected to server.please fix it soonIt is a totally unneeded app, it only uses up more space and has nothing to give, except the fact that it belongs to a rich and already famouse person, who made this app famous by use of an already existing platform just for his satisfaction.This is an incredible app, so much better than the competition:)At least have all the features of your competitor If you're going to make a copycat appThe feed is just a bunch of random people that the algorithm likes. If I don't follow them, I don't want to see their postsThis is tiktok but in form of a cheap ripoff of twitter. Recommendations are basically OF girls twerking trying to keep horny men on this platform.I just installed this app it looks like a fake app I like it a little bit आप लोग मुझे फॉलो कर सकते ह satu jodhpura...ke name se meri I'd h ....Please activate dark mode theme because android users are not available.Not able to upload high quality images.Just another platform for the famous and rich to speak and the rest of the world to be a ghost. If you're not a verified user with a built-in base no one will ever see a word you say.Much cleaner and not a mess like Instagram but copy of TwitterIf you have made this app different, then it is necessary for everyone to launch another different app. this app is very good enjoy itCan we please have the ability to to check in and also upload photos from Google PhotosYou should add reels section It could be great and fun application..Can we customize our homepage please? I don't want to open the app to see celebrities. Not interested.Please update more and more because feature are less then expected like Message and profile visit and follower check,story adding option and many more.Very good UI and probably a worthy opponent for TwitterI do not have an instagram account, si I cannot log in. So a BS app.I posted a few threads and after a refresh on the homescreen everything I posted disappearedVery wrost app ever to many glitch and functional issue very bad appMy photos are not uploading, it's so annoying.Why it's flickering while scrolling up the home screen please solve this issue for miui version 12.1Improvement : 1.Data Saver 2.Location wise content 3.Trending topic 4.Hastag 5. Edit button 6.Direct Message 7.Suggestion of who or what to followplease add translate feature... mostly i cant understand when i follow japanese friend..😅That's a very good app, very reliable and very easy to use, I highly recommend itGood, needs improvement include threads world news trends.Honestly, a great experience so far! I am enjoying it quite well!!Nice app but should have more features like trending and opinion poll,etc...Great application I really appreciate your app let's fly together and make it stronger 💪Cannot create a new account. Must attach to an Instagram account.Takes way too much personal information for no good reason. Just another clone of Twitter with creepy vibes installed.The app has a glitch on the interface... Kindly fix itUnlike this app, Twitter is for the free: Free speech. No government censorship. Less data collected. Contribute your voice to humanity’s digital public square! The best way to fight misinformation is to respond with accurate information, not censorship.Much better than Twitter Although I like using thread more than Twitter bcoz i am very active on Instagram and it's totally linked with this.This app is so disgusting because there are no girls in this app, it's full of white skinned bulls and I follow 2000 people but no one follow me..very unsatisfied mark.Just perfect.Hopefully you will also consider showing trendingsThere's no thread on my main page. I can only see replies, mentions or I need to go to a specific person page to see what they postedVery easy to use . With no ads yetGreat app but full of action blocked \"cannot upload threads\" properlyA little bit decent copy of twitter... Every body is going there ... So, why not ...Need more features and optimization.Great Start we need the \" Spaces \" option here it will be great and you should support all the big account in Twitter to move hereNo ads so far, no bots, and best of all no pervs.They require you to login with Instagram and there isn't even an option to sign up Twitter WOnly for Instagram users, I'll pass. Not to a good start only allowing Instagram zombies on this. Oh well, screw Threads and Meta, I'm staying with Musk and Twitter.My videos are mute always even, when all videos on other account have audioReally glitchy, I get an error trying to follow people.I'm giving Threads a 3 star for now because to reply a post is not quick. Replying a post should be fast. Kindly improve on this.Please developer, add a messaging key to it, so user can be able to message each otherWhen i was scrolling the app just crashed suddenly.So to delete my threads profile you want me to delete my whole Instagram profile too? So glad I haven't posted anything but it's time to delete the app already.Its very simple and improved as soon as passible like live and story and othersI love it 😍❤️❤️. Good job Meta, ur team did a wonderful app.This is awesome,no adds, and it's very easy to openApp is full of problems.I Can't upload my Profile Picture even......Such a useless app...😒Seems like a good app, looking forward for the future updates.It can hanged when my cellphone scrolling andnothing show character.I like threads as compared to Twitter it's more easy n convinent to use.Very user friendly.Can't access,on Amazon Fire even though Instagram works.It randomly exits while I'm trying to make a post.I was too surprised to see threads, it is more likely common to Twitter, hope in future it would have some great features that Twitter don't havesame as teitter , so not interested in more social platforms forms offering nothing new. tcsTwitter has nothing to worry about. Atrocious platform. Can't access my second account. WARNING-yoU cannot delete your Threads account without deleting your IG account.You can deactivate it but it will still be there collecting everything you do on IG.The app is nice, it's just that it keeps saying that the app went wrong after clicking on who repliedLove the Follow in future feature, for when more Instagram people sign up.Its basically take and collect all of our database from your device including everything you connected to your deviceI'm the facing the wave issue while scrolling the app. Please checkToo much data collection and can't trust meta with my data, history has proven that meta is selling data or it get leaked very easyThe app is easy to use and has a clean interface. It has all the features I need to stay connected with friends and family. I particularly like the community notes feature, which helps create a better informed world by empowering people to collaboratively add context to potentially misleading Tweets. I also like the new pic in pic feature, which makes it easy to watch video while scrolling the feeds. Overall, I would highly recommend this app to everyone.Good, aap is better than Twitter absolutely easy to use no problem in login 🙂 just awesome 🥰Can't switch accounts, no feed for people you follow. Pretty rushed job.Poor design. No use! Twitter is good and professionalCool app, its both insta and twitter combined. Very interestingInterface is not so good. Poorly designed appHas been having problem loading for days, completely unable to useJust a copy of Twitter. Nothing new or special. I liked the UI btwThis new update of instagram is good but it is a little bit like twitter. But whatever it is is good.Why is it not advertised letting us know that we can't delete this app unless we delete Instagram?? Posting with 5 stars to push to the topGreat app... it can only get better overtime.every time try to open it, it will kick me out of the app over n over, its giving me a hard time to write anything in threadsvery buggy. can't interact with it.Fantastic features and easily understandabledoesnt load , all laggy , experienced like someone hacked my phone lmao , uninstalled it afterIt keeps force closing whenever I want to post something. PEASE FIX THIS ISSUE ASAPMake this app part of Instagram in one app and also make this app to rotate because we need to rotateNo chronological/follows only feed. Useless as of now.Nice so far but the keyboard covers my message when I'm in the middle of typing so I can't see what I'm typing.Good but Urgently need the messaging and audio conversation room like Twitter spaces 😕App is not working properly and post also didn't ViralThis app so like Twitter an I like Instagram Twitter mix I honestly I have don't use I can my opinion an iam usest that app arjent is bee this app so interesting my opinion that use an so using the application like Instagram threads, an Instagram yes bee can I am rate this application ★★★★★ okay is that my opinion thanks for my opinionMy Instagram account is mostly about my dog. My Twitter account is professional. I was hoping this would replace Twitter, but I can't do that unless I can separate username from Instagram.Daily Night Crash screen bugs solve plz send me reply in mail and I send you picture bugs .The app is working great and beneficial ☺️ happy to have such open biased platformFor a v1 app that's fairly recent it's been a great strategy from Meta, as it goes on with more updates im sure it will riseScrolling through the content is not so smoothSometimes I load it and it closes down. I cant use it.Unable to login please wait few minutes before again pop up is showing 🤬 wrost appThis should be deleted it's literally Twitter but infinity times worse why was this stupid idiotic app created anyone who likes it is dum I do not recommend it get Twitter it is soooo much better don't install this waste of time app 😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎text selection is bothering UX facebook's component was much better please consider using that oneSeems lighter and easier to interact than twitterNo photo save option. Add an option to save photos/vidoes to our phone storage.It's was good but initially I started having issues I can't comment or post show me errorIt's very slow when it comes to uploading something.An unexpected error please try again letter very bad appGreat application, but I am facing a problem if I want to remove the add from someone, I cannotYou can only login if you are Instagram user, no sign up option.I've had the same few threads on my homepage since I installed this app, despite following nearly a thousand accounts.Why can't I send a direct text here,,,,it's not useful then!!!!I like it. It's easy to use. It just needs little tweaks.Can you update translation features into this threads.because it will be more useful for the users.Looks promising. Tidy interface. Good job.Please make this app alternative of facebook and Instagram merger together and loved it easy and neat to use ..Could be better. Needs more features to truly compete with TwitterScreen error while opening it can't operateThe app was made by Ctrl c Ctrl v It is very easy to make an appCannot login with gmail. Insta id needed. Plz solve for non insta users.There should be an option by which you can directly switch through your profiles, without logoutplease have a button where we can easily switch accounts and let us have topics to follow so that our feed have a linear topicsCan't see who I need to follow back. Difficult to go into each account and follow them back..What difference does it makes than facebook feed? Feel nausiatic even by just looking at the feed page.Can't cmt post on android, the keybroad hide the text inputApp crashing while trying to upload picturesBundling with Instagram is very annoying.It's glitching. Non stop. I couldn't see anything.Mine keeps having the glitch i don't know why what's happening??Congrats on using Twitter to reskim Instagram. But it works and there's no stupid paymentsApp not working properly. Full blurring.Good but had a bug it wouldnt let me add photo so had to reinstallIt's is laggy and very slow, Twitter Experience is the bestSuper fun, easy to use UI!Doesn't support image download like Twitter 😔, such a great alternative thoughThere are SOOOOO many things wrong with this app. 🤣 When is the cage match between you and chunk going down? I will pay pay per view prices to see thisIt is good to use or see & you can make it more better quality/maintenance of products & apps/websites & services etc company.It's pretty good if you have an insta account. There's not too mquch difference from TwitterThere needs to be a way to clear your timeline. I am seeing more posts from people that I do not know than my actual followers. Huge problem.From Bangladesh 🇧🇩 it's very useful 😎 . You can use it easily. It's best from Twitter 😅Cant upload an image says failed to upload thread if i try to add an imageI keep getting restriction without doing anything I don't know why you should just let thread be a different app, this app has too many buggs it is refusing to open I don't know why....Threads, improve instead of seeing people that didn't follow on timeline, please let us see only the people that we follow only.the feed is confusing. i carefully chose who to follow and yet ppl who i didnt follow are on my feed even if they're not reposted by my followed ppl.Text mix for full screen then nothing showingThere are some glitches while using this app like when i scroll the app please fix thatActivity page can't scroll, fix this bug.Its lagging too much..i cant do anythig on this app. Plss fixx itt!I think this app seem like Twitter a lot , It is very very well app hope to see it develop.One of the standout features of the Thread app is its user interface. It is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The design is aesthetically pleasing, with a focus on simplicity, which makes using the app a pleasant experience. Whether you're a tech-savvy individual or someone who prefers a user-friendly interface, Thread strikes a perfect balance.Interface is confusing rest its a nice copy of twitterSome bugs in this application please solve all problems...So i have to use my active Instagram account or create new Instagram account just to have threads account??? Also it’s not that i don’t recommended this app but if your account get suspended it’s gotta take your Instagram too..right?!? That’s why they are connected?? I’m not sure about this app but I will give it a try, I’m just gonna create new Instagram account just in case…I am very much impressed by using the app, so I will tell you the same thing, you should also do it by downloading this app. 🙆Simple, solid & easy to use!No search in the posts . It is useless and complete trashCan we please add a button where we hide our profiles from certain people, blocking people on this app blocks them on Instagram I can't have that.Still lacking features and lots of bugsLogging with Instagram shouldn't be the only option to sign on the appAdd a translation function we may have overseas friends.Keeps on crashing on androind, everytime I post a pictureStill lag,perhaps my internet connection, Opening Instagram no issueis there a button or feature that let only the accounts that I follow would appear on my feed/wall/page? if not, I hope the devs can add themNOT open social network as claimed. Even when it finally implements ActivityPub, still not 'open'. It's a scam.Please remove photos and video sharing option from threads. Atleast video .Make it just for writing . I don't want to see REELS in threads also🫣🫣The app closes on its own, that's why I can't finish what I'm about to post.i'm enjoying using this apps, the UI is more suitable for me and i love itThis is good but has no efficient features....The app looks great but can't be compared with Twitter 👑Their app is an Twitter bit and gan of install any router rate of out of tenBuggy application. May I have rmail for the support team to review this bug?Very Good App. But I need an option Download Media like Twitter...Worst experience ever, lags a lot. Just a bad copy of TWITTER.There is a lack of Messenger in this, if the messenger was in it, it would have been better. It would have been a very good app, but if there was a messenger, I would have given five stars. That's it for now.We need a translate post button to be able to translate posts that are from users who type in different languages please.Why is it drawing lines with the letters whenever i scroll up or down.App won't let me connect, keep giving errorGreat start, legends are always legends no matter how many falls they hadDO NOT USE THIS APP. The amount of data they are collecting and selling is RIDICULOUS!!!!Needs to have a built in translation system.In this app photo upload but me use and in this case not upload photo this not properly work application 😡when I open it, for some reason it glitches and I couldn't do anything about it.So far so good. Although the option to delete your Thread account seems dodgey because I still would like to keep my Instagram account 👀 Please find another way for thatNot at all working lots of bugs error while usingI would have loved to join but now the only log in option being Istagram is what held me back since am not on Instagram.Just like twitter, cute loll. Pretty alright but it would be better to make an option to see what the people you follow sayExcellent app experience.... This app is better than twitter.... I was download this app only for JR NTR SIR And all NTR fans are download this app and follow NTR SIRI got a few bugs. When i want to see someone's reply, suddenly force closeA torrent of meaningless celebrity spam and random posts from people I've never met.Always keeps crashing when iam trying to upload somethingI wonder if you were waiting to be told.... I just wonder. When refreshing for new feeds, you don't just snap the view to the latest feed. Just show avatars of accounts with new [recent or yet-to-be-viewed posts] and then we can scroll up to view at our pace. Again, I don't know if you were waiting to be told 😒... Until then, all you can boast of is \"look how many we are now 🤪!'.... 🤡sGlicty no DM and can't be deleted without deleting your Instagram account it's not very helpful we need so many updates plsfun app but been having crashing issues whenever I open repliesIt's showing refresh the page I'm trying since publication of the application.Why does it crash every single time I open it? ☹️So far I love it. 👍🏻 The new Twitter woohoo! Might add an option in the future to add a header?You need an Instagram account to sign up. There is not tags system, so topics are almost impossible to see without following people. Go back to twitter lol, or tumblr if you willThe app is very good for an innovation. But first and foremost we need DARK MODE.Mine is not loading(opening) again after I used it on the first and second day, what could be the reason?Missing: Character count, data saving settingsI highly recommend this Threads an instagram app the content please follow, share, and support this app😍✔️ Please ডাওনলোড this app😊😊 Thank you.Apparently you have to have Instagram to sign up. No, thank you.Threads need some translation cause being an international kpop fan is so hard when there's no translationsPretty good. But need insta account to loginWhy i have to log in by insta user?! actually I'm not using insta at all i think better to provide sign up option'sThe app has some bugs it is slow and laggyWe can write our opinion on any topic and its easy to useExcellent, finally an app much better than twitmusk.. Thank you fb and InstagramThe app is great but be allowed to talk freely here like it is in Twitter.App is soo exciting but unfortunately I tap on hide tread badge on ig plzz make it possible to unhide itThere are a lot of problems especially with the dark mode.No sound on my media/ videos after about an hour on and blue ticks everywhere 🙄Plz give an option to switch like Instagram why always need to log out it's irritating 🙄Really good so far. When other things get added that seem to be missing I'll put rating up to 5Too many pictures on the feed very very few actual threadsI had it for 1 day and already got my account hacked and taken and there's no support button so I can't figure out a way to get it backGreat app and easy to use just wished my home page just showed people I followKeep crashing so many times very poor experience for a userKeeps crashing when i attach a photo.save botton option, share via other apps and copy link... please.Not much This app i want to use because the app use top ten political leaders use the app in one of them the chairman of tareek e insaf imram khan he is my inspiration. I like who to guide youth of Pakistan not in the way of politically in the way of every type of life. He tell us the way of our hazart Muhammad SAW spend his life in the world before 14th century ago. I also like the way of talking adres the hole nation. He is also Oxford degree holder .he was also ex kaptan of Pakistan circket tWhy it keeps giving 'post failed to upload' error?One Twitter is enough, we don't need another, Update this app because they will fail if they continue like now...Free version of Twitter 😂 All Good needs some update for improvement.It's awesome and Twitter has been unmarked, it's fun to do that😘Allow quick user account switching for multiple accounts, Hope to see a PC web version soonInstagram alternative.. application... 😂😂😂 Without reel interface.. 😂😂😂Just another lame social media alternative that is never going to gain traction. Uninstalled.Still can't see from the following only this app doesn't worth your time . It forces you to see whatever they want not what you followGood and simple interface compare to Twitter 😍😍😍I 'm happyBeautiful UI and seems a very good competitor to TwitterJust signed up. So far much easier than Twitter 😉. Still navigating my way ☺️Kind like a Twitter knockoff and really just an extension of Instagram vs anything new.Twitter could never 🤷🏽‍♀️ Once you get on there's no getting off super addictive and fun 😭🙌🏽It keeps turning off, theres some bug in the appI loved the app very cool for everyday life, and excellent settings ❤️❤️The app perfect Got one feedback Could yal add GIF? It would be niceI love the experience I can follow all the people I want The image sharing / Gifs And video player god Dame works on this app I love it right nowFix the bugs it's been days and I am not being able to use itCan the app allow 2 accounts running at the same time.My phone screen is cracked so am not seeing the post very well... But base on people's comments here,it's really sad to divorce such a good man.Copycat of Twitter. Nothing novel, nothing innovative. Waste of space and bandwidth.The app keeps crashing, I have no idea what the problem is.Best application for new 2023.. please quick upload content creators...It's promising but please keep my feed stuff I follow. That is my biggest issue with that other app.Worse app plz don't download.... If u login then u CAN NWVER DELETE UR ACC IN IT ... SUCH A NONSENSE APPThe app crashes often hope you fix it soonThe app is okay But can you add dark mode to the featuresThe App is good but needs a lot of improvement. So far so good 👍i don't like the autoplay of videos ,it consumes unnecessary dataThere is no music on Button on videos...!!!!!!!!!!!!!Basically ads and silly left leaning goofy stuff nah I'm goodI installed this app and tried to open it..it's just blank and nothing is loadingI need data saver setting on it ...like media preview icon ..please Nice appGood app. Slow and registration is cumbersome.So Much Bugs In The App ! nothing Superb Features Copied Everything From TwitterShowing the same posts over and over with new posts once in a while no matter how much i refresh the feedMight get past Twitter soon, gotta add the list and pin list optionsReally good and easy to accessSo far so good simple app very smooth and softUsing this platform to blackmail others. It worths nothing. That's the most useless app to ever exist.Can you please add the ability to save photos and videosLike Twitter but better and less misinformation being spreadGreat start. Now keep updating it please.It keeps crashing when I'm uploading a photo.Stick it to Elon, but add curatable bookmarks? Would set it apart from other apps.App not working properly... overlapping textsNot sure why they created something similar to Twitter and the app is buggy.Looks a little weird!! But I'm down for the journey.Very good app. Welcome platform for positivityForce close when i tried to post pictures , using my phone Xiaomi Lite 12.Good but pls add save option to save fav tweet and share button toVery good app and easy to use from the stable of mettaPlease add a translate function for posts in foreign languages.Flexible currently. But should be improveThis app is kinda looks like Twitter. It is vesatile to use and makes by day even more better👍The UI is broken with my phone. I can't see anything.its okayy👌, but could you please add a translation button pleaseWhy the hell ppl I don't even follow and am no interested appear on my timeline? Everything is shoved at me. It's annoying and confusingIt needs a translation feature.Another way for meta to track you. That's it. They saw a gap forming in the industry and decided to take more for themselves. Meta very nearly has a monopoly on social media and is known to nab everything from your device they can just to sell for profit to unknown parties.Cannot scroll down on activity notificationsSo far it seems like a similar concept to twitter , let's see how long it is wholesome and lighthearted..I'll give 2star at this app cz when i was scrolling its very hang on my phone and the word are colliding bruhhhh!!!I got some glitches like screen is overlapping, profile is not openI loved it but we can't save pictures from there that's the problem for meLets see what it offers is new. 👀 there's nothing new, it's just clone of Twitter and I request play store to take it down.Can't log in, keep getting an errorAfter installation texts are overlapping on each otherGood app already. Can you make it landscape as well plsI am enjoying it so far but please make it so you can change between profiles!!No hastag or word search, basically still Instagram but rebranded.. so what is the point of it again?Smooth and very good UI designEvery single window is just overlapping on each other.The texts are all jumbled up. Cannot see anything.I like this application But It's needed to have translator to know threads written in other languagesIt's good app but theards that showed to me most of them or all of them belong to celebrities and influencers why normal people theards don't appear too it's all 🥲I would consider giving it an extra star if it adds more features. Although it won't be five stars because the community standards are rubbishNight mode is really need to dark.It's a very nice app but it would be better if space like twitter could be created hereReally great work mark sir I like the following features...The app keeps crashing when I enter a threadThis app are so wonderful app and awesome all abouts of this app are so good,but make stoory and chatting ❤️ vi hope u saw this adorable advice 😊Love it. It's going to take time to get all of our friends from the app that shall not be named over to Threads, so be patient with the content. Much like Instagram, it's going to show you celebrity content first. Just mute those accounts and seek out the content you want. Politics? Start with news orgs, then move to journalists. By 48-72 hours it'll start shaping up to what you had on the app that shall not be named pre hostile takeover by \"him.\"The app works but but it has soo many glitches I can't even see a single postKeeps crashing! Can't post anything.Less features than Twitter and a simple copy pasteI see choppy screens and it stutters so much on the home page please fix itNo support for large screen (foldable phone)Good app like Twitter we can share our bio from Instagram is good feature I might be a good competitor for muskIt's fun ...but need translate tweet option as soon as possibleReally really like Twitter. This is really a bad copy. Not authentic. Not a new idea. Threads is a model of anti free speech twitter.It's a nice app but it any upgrade also I feel like there need to be a app for adults onlyTwitter is many times best than this app because it is promoting those who are already verified and famous on Instagram!!!!! Where should new people go????? They have no Rights to gain fame?????Trash. It's a tracking app. Do not downloadCreate new account option is bugged. Could not create a new user name and now the app doesn't even provide the option to create a new account. #day1failNice app our experience is Like Instagram but my friends are not here so I not say it is bestkeeps crashing every time I click on a threadGreat another app full of bloated content I don't follow and I don't careAutomatically Locked me out of my account. Can't find a way to sign back in.As soon i logined it behave like laging or something like it, even I can't scroll it.So far so good. Unsure if it'll ever be what Twitter used to be, but I'm excited to see where it goes.Well designed UI and Experience Best alternative for TwitterWhat's the point of having the offensive filter on when the filters can't even block posts that contain obviously misogynistic language?I'm facing problem in my app! Suddenly my followers count not showing and also the instagram logoThis app is the better social media platform I have ever seen its easy to use and become famous.Looking forward for more updates and features for this new app!Decent, but needs work. I particularly don't like that I see all these accounts I don't follow. Seems pointless to follow anyone if you're going to see the entire world whether you want to or not.Instead of launching a new app . Make sure you are having a proper customer support system for users ....or provide a chatbot support system for the sake of public.... please...I didn't try the app, just logged in and figured out what is it about, so for now you get 3 stars.Full of content I don't care about. Waste of time and uninstalled.adding Hastag feature and also Trending Feature will be goodSo nice to have ga tab for mtlb and the new trending 3AM on kr 8443rd street is a great way of making the trilogy a little easier for ever than the other 9AM to be able for the 9PM and pan card to m baat kre thi way I Phone the phone and I Phone my 77feet 99feet account of the trilogy that wasIt is a combination of Twitter and Ig but where is the reel ?@threads . It is smooth and sweet .Rip Twitter n ig. 🫣Some glitches are happening in few phones please fix it..app crashes as soon as I add photo to postThe screen is getting glitched and it wont workIt seems crazy and better than Twitter... We will wait for more updatessuper smooth and easy to use, i'm impressedWhen I try to post the app keeps closing. Please fix itGreat news feed. I hate Twitter. Thank you for a great alternativeGood but they shd add more features to surpass Twitter. So I like to request Mark Zuckerberg & his team to pls add these features.👇 1. Should show no. of impression(views) in each post. 2. It should Show trending hashtags, # should work. 3. Theme should be impressive. 4. There should be inbox section to message privately. 5. It should show both followers & following on the profile. 6. There should be EDIT Button in every post. 7. Must add Poll section for voting. 8. Live Video should be there.Amazing UI & incredible User Experience!!This is the best app i never seen keep it up instagram keep going 🙌❤️Zero stars I shouldn't be forced to have Instagram to use this app when this app is supposed to be like Twitter. Fix this because I refuse to have another app just to use a Twitter based app until this is changed I will not ever touch this app. Twitter doesn't make me need another app to use it so this app shouldn't force me to need another app to use it.You must add the translation button!!The app will crash when i want to post a picture:(I am very said when i have a fastest internet and the thread is always loading loading and loading very disappointedBasic Twitter clone. All the hub bub is that . Apparently if still you want the experience, Twit is where you should beUseless to me, it don't have, nor do I want, an Instagram account. Uninstall.I just want please remove that annoying thing where many random people's threads are coming on the app feed it's very irritatingWorthless app for now. Created out of spite for another website, you know the one. Will update if it ever gets better.Looked good to me, and wasn't getting any spam, or trolls.. still working things out,like is there a way o see people that I'm not followingGood so far. Hoping they keep the vileness of the blue check app away.Zuck's dev team is really doing a great job. The app is so so inspiring.Tbh App Is more clean And Great And For now it has no ads so it feels great to use🙂Wow this app is the best.everybody feels related,it's such a close community.just wish it had more features.everything is good but this app name not suitable so i request to change app name...So buggy! My feed and updated do not load.It is easy to use, and it isn't a hell scape like Twitter.Refresh automatically need to be switch offHey Threads! Where's the save button of photos?While trying to upload photo the app is crashingSo easy to connect with contacts, brands, and influencers.Very interesting and beautiful friend and my phone I love you Threads app very Nice app and android device VersionThis is really a best app created by meta where we can interact with our favorite celebrities 🙂👏❤️👍Decent start, felt like rushed with so many bugsNice but mark should also add chat and story feature.Ultracensored piece of gardage which besides that also spying big time.Something to do, since I don't want to use twitter anymore. Can't support that, or tictoc.Too many random people in my feed, can't find content from the people I followimprove Performance some devices (Android) getting huge glitches ....It's a good start. I wish there was a translation button.For some reason whenever I try to post a picture threads keep stop working 🤦🏻‍♂️It is just like Twitter and same as Instagram but it is a good app. I love it.Instagram + Twitter = Instter😂 Useless and time waste application.I would like to be able to search by threads text and not Just the accountsThe app is really slow comparing it to Instagram and twitter👌This app is good but if you get verified badge, then you would rate full 5 stars.

Thank you Mr. Zuckerberg 💪👍🥰🌹🤩Keeps on crashing whenever I attached photo.Cheap app for cheap people, copy paste of Twitter, i request people to delete this app..Very bad too many bugs app not working properlyThis app doesn't offer enough to be worth the privacy nightmare it unleashes and destroying fediverseWhats nonsense, if we want to deactivate it's account(including profile and data) we have to delete our Instagram account.Visual bug can't even use to scroll listThe application is very good, it is very good compared to the twitter , it is a lot of fun to useIt's a good app but no right to free speech in the appbug and glitch are disturbing while i'm scrolling on it.Very good for simple social media apps category ⚡Why is it necessary to have an Instagram account to open a threads account!? I don't have insta. So I will never be able to use threads!? No thank you!Avinash Singh rajput... 1st of all this is work like Twitter this is best for the chats ...like. I am very impressed for the used this app.. thanks this is helpful....,......A lot like both Instagram and Facebook; Useless.Keeps crashing on my Honor phone when I try to quote tweet, reply on a thread add an attachmentCrashes every time when opening a threadInterface is minimal but awesome than twitterI hate all platforms from your meta, because it lost our time, so our should egnore all of this social media sites.I don't want to see post from people I don't follow, I only want to see things from those I follow. Don't force feed us other companies or people, if you must do that have it on a separate tab.There are so much glitches in the interfaceExcellent customer service and support I just love itSmooth use and great features.I'm one that I didn't hate or love Twitter. But I thought I would try this out like the other social apps recently. And Threads has it right it's easy to use and I like that you can just use all of you just snyc all of your IG followers. They have that info anyway. The only thing is there's not very much socializing Yet.What a laggy app...after longing the screen goin freezed....pls fix this upApp is glitching. Not working in my device 😔You must have an Instagram account to get this. There is no way to just build an account on threads!confusing and difficult to useGood app. Can't share posts with Instagram and FacebookSeriously i am unable to login always saying check few minutes later. I tried after 2 hours still saying try few minutes later. It suckPlease add a switch account feature. Also, save images and download videosCompetion is good, an alternative to Twitter was long due.Can't upload anything, the app kip stopping when I do, any recommendations???Threads app Very amazing my feelings is Very good i have been used early morning I think so these is very good aapUgh, Mr. Zuck collects too much personal data with this app. Let alone all the political bias on his platforms. Stay away!I will give it a five star....It's easy to use and the developer did a very good jobThreads is a very good app i love it and i use it instead twitter and u can find you'r instagram friends in itIt's literally Twitter but by instagram. Just like how instagram reels is just tiktok, but by instagramThis app is nothing special other than hiding and filtering the truth that must be known u can not express ur opinion freely on here and the home and the idea is all a taken idea so I call it a copy paste but I give it a F because the filtering is making my blood boil I want to have a free opinionIt's a good app but it should have included polls and hashtagsDoesn't work properly Whenever I scroll it started glich in it .Overall, ‘Threads’ is awesome. But I want to ask, when Threads is powered by Instagram, why aren’t Instagram followers being transferred to ‘Threads’?”My experience are so bad and worst experience in this app 🤮🤮🤮😠😠😡😡🤬🤬 this is very bad application please don't install the appPlatform is best but trends is not showingPromising. However, there' s a very scary feauture that most are not aware of: deleting your THREADS account automatically deletes your Instagram account. Seems that this app was created to wipe out the ability to anonymously post as was the case with Twitter. Now, everyone posting from Threads will be directly identifiable with an Instagram acount (stay tuned for the day that you must PAY a subscriber fee to maintain existing accounts on Threads/Instagram).We need trending feature.. and something like explore🙏🏼Can you add voice message along with the threads you are posting also put translation features lets gooovideo is not working correctlyApp dont run well while scrolling text crash Just photoes show wellsuddenly My feed is full of photos and people I don't follow .. I'm here for text not looking for another IGAdd \"STORY\" in top. Or please hide the Replies option from account details page. Add \"DATA SAVER\" option also.It's has a bug when scrolled down everything is like getting shadedCan't edit, deleted things still show. Make it better.Not Twitter or Tiktok = banging app, plus I like how it's similar to MastodonYou can't use keywords to search for topics,big negative for me but I am looking forward to seeing the development processFeed doesn't show people I follow?!. Can't download images.Threads is like Twitter, but without Twitter - perfect.It is not working properly i hate this app there are too many issues in this appwhen I try to post some pictures, it suddenly lags and remove me from the appJust perfect. Already switched from Twitter 💀It crashes a lot i hope they can fix itIt's not as good as Twitter, but something new from the meta is welcomed.Soo dark. Also it's like an unlimited message just bombed on ur screenYeah! Here is the new Social Media Application by Instagram which is something cool and interesting one to share your Thoughts & Views..... and what not.....😇Garbage app. You'll never be good at anything copying someone else. How's that 1 billion a month going with the metaverse? 😂😂😂 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️I was very excited to use this app. Love it more than Twitter <3 if it has trending section.I installed it but I am not on Instagram and I don't want to be on Instagram.How can I sign up without having to create an account on Instagram?Zuckerberg finally gets his act right. Excellent twitter spin off, much better and surely a necessary competition in Musk's monopoly with twitter. Can foresee threads replacing the popular app soon!I don't have control of anything.. I can't even close my thread account without closing my Instagram account.. Please, come Blue Sky, I really hope you're what I'm looking for.This app not reach my expectations not good interface not useful at allI know it's early but i already love it. Hope they will put an edit option though.Average at best. Needs a lot more workIt is continously crashing on my device, Redmi note 8!i can't save images. So why would even want to use this compared to TwitterDon't use this app if you installed this app and log in with Instagram id your not delete threads account. If you delete your threads account than Instagram account also delete.The app keeps removing and crashing in android 😠It's a W app but taking time to refresh maybe cuz it's first day and too many people are using itWhen i tried to post a thread with picture it not responding and going to home automatically 😶 worst experienceSeems like I'm the first reviewer.....let's see threads look way better than Twitter with good infuncer support.... gonna rock🪅Not the greatest could be better. The fact so many accounts exposed how many fake bots they have and ai responses is sad. Fundamentally lazy appThe best app and the best alternative for tweeter , now Twitter will come back to their position, and also the first review on threads appNice app.. but crashing sometimes and plz add DMs!!app crashes instead of loading stuff 👎Another Amazing One, Let's TryIt And Come Back With The Real Review. 😍😍❤️❤️ I Love It,The letters and numbers are too dark using a Dark Theme.Needs more features and stabilityHonestly this app is till in its testing stage, bugs on top of bugsI can't use the app at all. And it's also not opening well.Handling reports on Instagram was awful and it will definitely be worse in this appNo double tap to zoom No save pic option No save video option5 stars because its new... But.... Im using a Samsung S7. And when i try to make a thread, my keyboard blocks the make thread button. Or im just really dumb. But the keyboard wont disappear = cant post thread.Can't create an account in app. Instalock on instagram.Amazing app like a Instagram and same as Twitter. Enjoying for using this app. I recommended you may download now. ✨So Many Bugs. When i tried to Replying Other people Post, it keep 'force close'.Worst app. Nothing fun here. Collects user data without you even knowing. Drains battery.I believe it will be a good application, there is much more to be done, but it was a good move from Mark.It need to be more optimizable and lite.App is not running properly, glitchesMine isn't functioning well.. It's hanging words are writing over each otherHi, my app closed automatically when I was writing. Is there anything I can do to solve it?Very familiar like tweets you can use. And connect with Instagram and experience your threads also connect with your if followers is cool . Best of luck of good reach for threadIt's a great start! I do feel like when adding photos we should have the ability to choose what album we pick from bc I have a ton of images on my phone and scrolling to hunt for them in 10k images isn't fun. Also I feel like there should be in app DMs as that's part of what makes things like Twitter so usable the ability to talk to our friends about threads or post. To what I DO love is the ability to add more than four photos at a time, the ability to write long multi post threads.Hoping this would be easier to use than Twitter. But it's more difficultAdd feature for saving pictures and videoThat's a best platform to be connected with your own Instagram and use Twitter as well😉😂Very good app but allowed save option and hashtag pleaseBad app freezes all the timeIts ok, no way to save pictures.Instagram becomes the another version on TIKTOK and this app called \"Threads\" Becomes the another version of Twitter.Cool! Totally improve then twitter when create some thread more simple I don't need to post-> reply -> postThe UI is interesting I think it will replace twitter soonUploading photos is always a problemBest thing about this app is staying close with my friends and familyBad thing is that if we delete or deactivate th thread app, automatically instagram will deactivate 👎👎Too many bugs yet to be fixed 😕Good and easy approach for Threads platformOnly issue is that I haven't figured out how to filter out threads from accounts I don't follow.Usually bad .. post doesn't edit very poor update.So far is very nice, but I am hoping to see integration of hashtags like twitterEasy as hell to access, simple, easy to manage. Day 1 and I'm soldLoving it so far. Would love an edit feature tho ❤️Crashes several times when I open any thread...Add more account login features... As soon as possibleApp is crashing, can't post or comment on anything.Pretty good as of now. Keep it good so we'll move from Twitter to THREADS!!!lol I get bug although I restart or also restart phone it keeps it problemGood start, kindly add feature to edit my posted comments and vote/poll option.Unstable homepage... Can't see any contentNice idea, but it's chaotic... I don't want to see random people's threads. I just want to see my friends' threads...App is getting crash while opening user repliesI liked the concept of the app. It is truly competitor of TwitterI'm tired of reading cringe tweets from blue check accounts that are trying too hard to farm engagement.Wow but reels option is not there so over all experience is 👍 goodNO BODY will see your posts if you haven't any followers on instagram already! Totally useless. I'm unistaling this.Missing a lot of basic featuresI have a issue to upload pictures there is some glitch 😕 you have to update the aap to resolve the problem my threads I'd 5587922Very beautiful It is considered a strong competition with TwitterNice for now. I hope it will not become twitter. LE: now I have 'something went wrong try again' and I can't see comments, page and profiles..Not able to poat anything amd change my profile pic, it says your thread failed to upload.Great app but I can't see the views count on any videoThe only issue I have is there's no follows tab so the feed is cluttered I don't want me feed full of celebrities I don't care aboutplease stop the auto play of videos and reduce the app sizeSo much bugs or lag in app also a rendering.Welcome to woke twitter, plus more data harvesting for Zuck.Apps alright but probably won't use it as much as twitter.Literally it gives a great experience It is more better than any social media appI thought it's a chating app but problem we can't delete because my insta I'd will deactivate 😔😔Needs more features and a Follow only feedLacks so many basic features of a discussion platformIt doesn't work properly, crashesWhy anyone wants to see same thing which is already their on Instagram? Linking with insta is the bad decision.I've been using this app for few hours only and it starts glitching.Very good app, but it keeps crahsing now. That has to be resolved.Instagram is also a good app but you are insulting yourself by launching this app because you are copying Twitter app and not launching any other thing.I'm worried I can't save videos or pictures... that's a problem thoughWhy my app keeps crashing while uploading my photo? Please helpThis app is to clear and smooth, please don't start ads on this appWhy I can't have access instantly from one acct to other? Do I need to log out everytime?I mistakenly hide thread from main Instagram page can I get it back on my main Instagram account 😕 if yes then how . Direct connect to threads 😞.Many Bugs Including Sudden App Crash In Certain Threads & Sometimes It Says Content UnavailableWhy doesn't it have a dark mode??? Needs a dark mode.Not working properly and I can't see what's on screenBest App, please provide hashtag follow option and also provide recent option in search sectionSo buggy that the text glitching out when open the app.I don't want to see unknown accounts in my timeline. I want to live inside my own bubbles. Please make this option available.Terrible App ... crashing every 3 minutesOk great app but, maybe let us save pics and videos?it keeps bugging, i can't read post from my phoneVery useful and convenient app in the worldFix the damn replies it crashes when I tap to open themVery good but service needs to be improvedalgorithm sucks and no \"not interested\" option.The app is good but it lacks somethings but I think it will be done in the future.Very basic. Third rate Twitter knock off. Just get Twitter.If you copy something at least make it better than the original. This is utter rubbishvery cool twitter substitute keep it up meta, don't keep developing the metaverse thoPlease add \"confirm all\" button for follower request. Thanksnot properly functioning in android version 9Clean design and glitch free so farIm so loving it! Still exploring while enjoying it! 💙Twitter sucks and is for the MAGA Repubs. This is a great alternative. <3Minimalist and clean UI DesignI get the idea of competitive marketing, but making it this aggressive and making me have to delete my linked instagram to threads. U get one starVery poor service not usefull Twitter is very good better service and New update..It's very simple, boring, and boring.A promising competitor to Twitter. I just wish there's an option to hide threads from people I don't follow on the news feed.I'm currently using my Lenovo Tab 4 8 to join Threads. At first, the UI seems it's not optimised for my tablet, it's just glitched out and can't read any threads, making it unusable. I think the UI is only optimised for phones, and not tablets. I guess I'll be using the web version of Threads (if it's available) until you fix the UI. Also, Threads functions like that one bird app where everyone is literally angry about, and yes, Threads is like an alternative to that app!Very basic and poorly interfaceIt was enjoyable up until the point where I signed out of my account to create a dump account with my dump account on Instagram and immediately saw the error notice. I waited as instructed, which was a few minutes. Few minutes has passed and still got the error sign. I deleted it and tried again, but the same thing happened. Currently, I'm VERY CONFUSED.The user experience so far so good, clean and neat, and easy to navigate through, my biggest problem with it, that there's no Dark Mode so far, and the people following you can easily find and follow you back, which is a thing that I should choose instead of the system choosing it for me, I acknowledge it's an Instagram App, but when it to comes to the user choice, it's better to let the following stuff up the users themselves, not automatically you find the same list migrating to threads..100% unusable, the posts and texts on the timeline overlaps (like constantly scrolling & overlapping the post like hundred times) make it not even readable. Bugs? super bad UI? not fully developed app? IDK, I'm using Android OS 9, ram 6Gb, maybe they develop the app for the newer version OS first. Unfortunately i can't send a screenshot. Anyway, completely inoperable, uninstall immediately.I know it's a new app but I think the feed needs a more variety of posts, maybe we can choose what interests we have so we can see what we want, it's full of verified users on the feed so it feels boring to scroll. A problem I have with the app is when I try to upload a picture, it just closes so I hope that gets improved in the future.I have 2 instagram accounts and I used my alternative one for this app. After few hours, my instagram app kept crashing whenever I switch into my main account (that's not connected to threads) but it's fine if it's the alternative account I used for threads. I kept on uninstall and re-installing, clearing data, and such to fix the bug yet no changes happened. Please, fix this.Lack of accessibility options. Lack of clear search filters. Lot of accounts I don't follow in the feed. Not clear how it works or decides what to show who but I see almost 0 from people I follow and almost 100% of everything I don't follow. It's great as a Twitter alternative and even better than Twitter but it could use a bit of clarity to figure out how to connect with other interests and accounts. Needs some kind of explore feature or hashtag search feature.Okay, pretty good start but there are a few deal breakers. #1 Carries your Instagram account, Anonymity is lost if you want to use the login for both #2 There isn't a page where I could only see posts from the people I follow, only the home page exists which is good at recommending new stuff but I can't find ANYTHING back after I scroll pass it once #3 Can't save photos. Why. Apart from theese, app works perfectly. Had no issues setting up, running, usingNon-linear timeline and buried in inline adsReally not that good. It seems like it was released before it was ready. Very unintuitive. Accounts blocked on Instagram still have easy access on Threads. The time line, or whatever it's called is just a random blast of the most basic, Access Hollywood celebrity press releases.It's not quite ready to launch yet, I had download/install this app as soon it came out so far so good nothing Hasn't been crashing, and etc yet but after few days give it like 2 days for it to start crashing and etc. But I had deleted the app to see would it stop but I don't know if it would. But I gotta feeling it's a problem with the software. And it started to crash today like I can't thread a post but it doesn't show a like when I had liked a threads but I can't comment on their threads.It's engaging and interactive. Since the app is still in its development phase, I won't comment on that. However, I wonder if there is any chance that our Instagram and Threads account could be independent of each other in future. Lots (like me) might have two different accounts on Instagram - maybe one for pictures, another being content specific (poetry, photography etc). But for Threads I would any day prefer just a single account in my name.I recently had the pleasure of using the Theard app, and I must say, it has completely transformed the way I communicate and collaborate with others. easy-to-use , user-friendly ! *In next update please add the option of adding more accounts like Instagram & double tap to like the threads etc...*This app sucks. It's key problem is that it CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT DELETING INSTAGRAM. Do not download this app. I don't see many people using it either. It asks for many permissions when creating an account with no warning that you cannot remove the threads link from your profile or delete your account. It's a data miner with no benefits.It's a twitter killer app, it's kinda fancy but then its major downside is its limitation to the Close Friends list, potentially restricting the user’s reach. Also, as a separate app, it might require users to switch between main Instagram and Thread apps to access the full range of Instagram features. So to me it's a 4star appPlease make feature that makes me can see post only from people i follow... too much post I'm not interested in my timelineFrom the stunning visuals to the endless array of creative and engaging and interact with people, Threads is perfect for those coz has it all. Also the layout is perfect designed, the functions and options are good developed l. Feed personalization could be better... Pls check it's not good like Instagram .. In short thread is awesome than the twitter😀 Regards from, Zanzibar, Tanzania🇹🇿, East AfricaHey Creator, Is there any problem with threads it's not running in my phone! The homepage of thread buffers and all the texts, posts etc overlap each other. I have tried all the possible things like reinstalling, rebooting my phone, etc. Please try to fix the bugs. Thank you!!Very simple, sweet, easy to use and everyone is nice. Could use some things to help organize it like a media tab or a \"following\" feed or maybe more ways to customize your profile like a banner but overall it's really nicely put together and honestly very approachable. 10/10 for a new appMeh. I really wanted a good alternative to Twitter but this isn't it. The UI is pretty basic looking and there's just no settings. It starts showing loads of threads from people you aren't following and you can't stop it. It's basically always stuck on the \"for you\" section on Twitter.So many issues. I couldn't see my own profile page, other people page, my replies, notifications, etc. The only thing working for me is the feed, which filled from a bunch of accounts I'm not following. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still runs into the same problem. I'm using Google pixel pro.Upgraded to 5 star cause meta team heard my complaint as soon as I reported it. the bug I've experienced earlier before the update was fixed already and I can use the app now normally no matter what the theme is. however, it looks like the update was only intend to fix the bug issue + performance improvement and nothing more. anyway, the app looks nicer now and smooth after the update but, surprised to see how rapid the ratings of the app recede in a couple of days after the launch.It's not bad but it has some way to go before it can compete with Twitter. For me personally the app is just too basic and lacks features. Also, not a fan of not being able to register via email rather than through instagram. Obviously it's still early days but I'll be uninstalling for now.Overall it's a good idea, but I hate that it only has a for you page (so you have to see everyone's posts, not just those you follow), and that your account cannot be deleted unless you delete your Instagram account, too. And once you link your ig account, you can't change your name, username, picture, or bio unless you change it on instagram. It'd be a much more enjoyable app if the two weren't so tightly connected and if you weren't forced to see posts from people you don't like or care aboutThe app closes/crashes whenever I try to attach an image to a thread, I didn't have this issue yesterday when I downloaded it. Uninstalling the app for now until it's resolved. Also I don't like the algorithm, hope they fix it cuz it shows threads from people I don't care about 😬 With lots of improvements, I know this app will be better.Within two hours of having the app, I had to deactivate the account; it messed with the security on not just Instagram, but a couple of other apps on my phone as well. I will NEVER recommend this to anyone, not even an enemy.I had to reset my password to deactivate my Instagram. When I reactivated it, I couldn't log back into threads because the password had been changed. Uninstalled and reinstalled, app kept crashing. When the app actually worked it was one big endless thread of people I didn't even follow.Everything seemed fine, some little glitches when needing to verify my account but the problem started when I went back onto Instagram and couldn't access my homepage as it was replaced with a while screen saying \"Welcome to Instagram. Follow some accounts\" while giving me suggested accounts, treating me like a new account. I've deleted both apps multiple times and restated my phone, worked for a little but now back to how I mentioned. A real pain, I've sent complaints but nothing yet.Too much bug detected... Not usable.This app is NOT good at all. Do not waste your time trying to make it work. The algorithm is the worst recommending stuffs that are completely different from your insta account. It seems like people are just tryif to use the app, but there is nothing really interesting A complete waste of time. I'll stay in Twitter btwI have Twitter, and hate Musk, so I thought I would give this a try. No way to sign-up. Just tells me to log in with my Instagram account. Never had one, never been on Instagram, and I have no interest in creating one. Would have given it a shot if it didn't ask me to create this account on a different data stealing app. But because it did, I just deleted the app.Right now it is better than Twitter and better give a update to download photos in Instagram we can't so here it is betterApp is glitching too much i m not able to use it posts are flying i hate it 😭This is fully bugs in open app I waste of my time and my expectations and netThreads team Add photo and video download option and add save post option also Upcoming update Thank you 😊A platform to stay positive and find happiness at minimal things. Threaders Unite! Don't know for how long this positivity will continue to exist but right now it is at its optimal level, #KEEPONTHREADINGIt's good but I don't like the fact that we cant edit threads already posted...I wanted to tag someone on an existing thread I created about 5minutes ago and realised there was nothing I could do other than to delete the post. In all the post is good...they should also try to help low account people so there threads can have at least some engagement.The best platform and the most used platform is much better than Twitter😒❤️🍷I use an Android phone, using all other meta apps currently, this app has issues with interface, when windows got stuck and we would drag a dialogue box it created multiple lagging images, same thing happened with the entire feed as I was scrolling, even after restarting the app.Good app absolutely good from Twitter best place to follow people and make a social relationship with themFor a just starting app, it's suprisingly good. Like astonishingly so.Lack of search option makes it less Twitter-y!Won't be using it until there's an option for a feed that only show who I follow.It was very good app and it will definitely break Twitter in 1 yearLike a simpler Twitter, and don't you have to pay to consume content!I didn't know I must have an Instagram account to access threads. Lemmie stick with Twitter for the time been.very bad app please put options to delete account permanently...This app is facing massive glitch. I installed this app 3 times and I even rebooted my device but it still didn't resolve the issue. I can't even scroll properly even after refreshing my feed 5-6 time. I was pretty excited to use this app but my experience was ruined. I am highly disappointed with it's user interfacetheres a text limit up to 50 characters only, i cant write freely because of that, sue itHavent been able to use it since i dl it, just keeps saying sorry, something went wrong 🤷User friendly app with good interfaceAt the moment the app locks users into specific agreements and features with no way to opt out later. The environment ruled by policies that effect ordinary people's ability to share their hobbies as well.Please, make it easier to upload pics from galleryTried of login page error showing every timeI liked it's user interface. Easy to use. I liked it very much.compatibility issues in low end device especially even my deviceNot soo... good the followers have very hard...not like Instagram...🙂Great...no subscription or limitations problemApp is very good but keeps crashing.Thread is As same as Twitter , there is no any inovative thing occur. Thread team must have to improve the user interfaceIt is a very unique app in terms of design 🫡It's good be use, but can't do Hashtag Trending for IdolsIt's just better than twitter,Instagram,facebook and even telegram 😂❤️It's not ready yet. I'm not sure why people even spend time on it. I chose pages and people to follow, but my feed showed everybody. I muted a bunch of feeds with no success to clean it up. There needs to be a feed tailored to Followed pages and people. I'll return to Threads when that is implemented.Dear team, When I using, loading bug show I attached screenshotIt's literally a poor rip-off of Twitter with more questionable data ethics (more tracking & more of the censorship industrial complex).This is awesome application by meta. I really like every functions in this appGreat interface and user experienceThere is many problems like direct massages, hashtags and more Please first complete a project then release it!All applications of Meta Company are very beneficial for business. Thank you!Add Trending option and hashtags option. Please update logo like what's show in app logo in colour and logo in colour is better than Balck and white. Please update logo and update appNice app for sharing thoughts and ideas.This is better than using tritter even though i haven't used twitter but I give Instagram and their new app Threads 100/ 100 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍😊😊😊🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗In this app we can't write more while posting the news or information on anythingExceptionally laggy, takes about an year to installOpen to new experience. Very curious. Seems welcoming, positive. Might update stars/review later.Fantastic easy to use . Easy termsI've tried various photo-sharing apps, but Thred stands out from the rest. Its intelligent thread suggestions and tagging features make it effortless to group and find photos. The threaded conversations create a narrative around the photos, making them more meaningful and memorable. Thred has become my go-to app for reliving experiences and sharing stories with loved ones. It's a must-download!\" Remember, these reviews are fictional and provided for illustrative purposes.Needs more features. You can't search posts. You can't use Hashtags. If you have a lot of Instagram followers, then chances are you'll have threads followers. Otherwise, there's no other way to get followers on here. I hope that you develop this app furthermore.The app was working fine earlier, now I can't even log in :')Good start .. Needs widget and some improvementsmore need to develop and also,develop the all likes in proflieNot working properly on Android 9the app pop up and bug again😑please fix it !Great App ! Will surely improve with timeI hve been facing bug on home 🏠 hope u fix asap excited to explore more i give u 5 stars fr now.No hashtag, no trending topics, timeline was filled with unfollowed users 👎🙏🏻In android, the screen and texts are smearedThere is so much glitch when I open the app tha app crashesAll Good But Refresh & Scroll Rate is To Much Slow Please Work On It...I like it 🙂 this is new one slowly get new features soon I was waiting for that'sWe NEED translations please... other than that like so farPointless unless your have Instagram, which I don't and never will.let's liven it up together, let it be more exciting like Instagram.But I'm having issues mentioning @ or trying to post a write up all of a sudden it just goes off like it just disappear 😔😭Copy cat cant even do basic functions properlyYou cannot delete your threads account without also deleting your Instagram account and they require you to fork over intrusive amounts of personal data, until this greviois oversight is fixed, stick to twitter or twitter alternativesNot useful because we cannot watch reels like InstagramGood aap. It's good to see that they are providing a threads version.I can't apload any photos coz it doesn't show the attachment iconMany times Short or Video Sound not downloaded with thread ... 🤔Wait for tablet ui ☕🗿 -Remove share via direct in browser(I know, It's use Instagram based)whenever I try to post a picture this app gets closed automaticallyGarbage. Fake social media. Predetermined popularity. No useful functionality.Koo is much better as twi alternative, Instead of developing it you should take over Koo app.The greatest ever and more than that bird icon with blue colour 🤟😎🤣Confused how it works besides not able to delete account as it warns of deleting the Instagram account as wellA Solid Twitter alternative yet there is a long way to go.The app is amazing, it's very simple to login AmazingTheme option should be added and the dark theme sucks make it black/amoledI am unable to log in to threads!! I don't have an Instagram account. Is there no other way to log in?Its boring. No news tab. Waste of time.Not able to login back, glitch in this rooThere is actually no purpose of this app except being professional here and casual at fb.Twitter alternative but the interface is confusingIf you log out sometimes it softlocks the app until reinstallAs soon as i open this app The whole screen starts to glitchDon't like the future 🔮 ➕ ✔️ you need to add the fullest futures so that it's can be doneStupid copy of Twitter, just make something original instead of copying things for money.I wish we could follow only our friends and nobody else I'm in America and half of the posts are in a different language so I'm guessing it's spamVery bad... Many screens open in one screenDon't have Instagram, don't want Instagram, I'm not installing Instagram to get this app. Sticking with Twitter.I think the #thread is not different from Instagram so it is a waste of time to use it 🙄 #IrfanAliI give 5 STAR For This New Idea From @META This The Best Feature From TWITTER I Don't Use Twitter Any Time But This App Is Great Then My Experience Level Up.But You Don't Give A DARK MODE In This App I Requested You For DARK MODE I Don't Consume My More Time In THREADS.. PLEASE Take The ACTION On My FeedBack THANK'S @META TEAM✅I used this app however this is somewhat appears to be the clone of Twitter application but yeah even better in some ways from it. Likewise, it's UI is more user friendly and it's very smooth but features and not so much. So I request Instagram to please add more features and update this app on a interval basis. Then definitely this app will be the best also after crossing Twitter.Having trouble setting up/managing multiple profiles.Whenever I go to post something, it will crash. Solve the problem.Very interesting social networking app. I love this app. Far better than Twitter.extremely buggy not worked for a single minuteSO FAR SO GOOD I like it lol it's clean and refreshing. This is just the beginning too, sheeshNice app but just it doesn't upload some pics .....why does it have to select the pics?!A littte bit cool like a twitter. But it's really bad because just no good at the reasonApp is glitchy. It paints/blurs all over when i scrollPretty darn solid option on the social media landscapeAdding a share option to a single person (DM) would be greatIt's not opening up and it says it's being updated and try again laterThis app is trash crashes multiple timesThe instagram account I used to open one here can no longer be accessed through my phone, as if I'm locked out. This wasn't an issue until I had conveniently set it up. Until this issue is resolved and my account is given back I will no longer use this service and actively ward others away from it.BEST APP TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE ON PUBLIC !!! Im so happy with this app and this company for having the best apps in this world !!!😭💕Languages should be translated down,edit of the post and downloadMy account suddenly locked/blocked for no reason, no notifications why I got lockedAmazing app Like instagram it would be better if it shows who I follow on the profile 🌻🤟🏾Make it so you can easily save images that people postCrashes from beginning not able to useGood idea but translator isn't available why??Feels the same like insta. Tbh this is like a trap once u sign up, there is no going back.Uploads keep failing to retry not that good rn needs improvementIt steals almost all of your data, is it definitely not a virus?When I try to write a thread it keeps crashing again and againAll I see is photos everywhere instead of textBad login system and worst interface.User friendly app with attractive UI.Good Threads is an app from Instagram where you can post threads, reply to others and follow profiles you're interested in.Facing lots of bugs rn, lagging a lotSo for so good. But I guess poll feature is missing.Not use full for now and not worthy it's a total time wasteCannot post anything or see replies to threads posted by others. Uninstalled an reinstalled. Nothing.It's a good app, threads is here to make life easier. I have been using it like 10years now, and I downloaded it before I was born... 5star fo itI see it as an alternative to Instagram and Facebook. Twitter users are different. Instagram and Facebook will sufferI'm feel too much lag and buffering issue in thiss application,Bottom bar should auto-hide while scrolling.Can't tell it works great, bugs and weird animations, even though it's still early... it looks a lot like twitter, so i would recommend some visual changes if possible. Thank you.Need more features like trending threads and intrest based threads and message to individual following and followers count at same place. Need hashtags, bookmarks ,customized bookmarks,pollsmap sharing, translation of threadsConstantly crashing. Been trying to upload a picture for 4 days now. Can't see my profile page. Can't see my notifications page. Just keeps displaying \"sorry, something went wrong.\" Haven't been able to use the app in 4 days now.Very useful. And it's more soft than that other social app.I signed up to see messages from people I follow, not crypto bros, celebrities, and Wendy's.Very nice app. I'm enjoying it. Great job Meta! 🙂It's not working properly on 9 pie androidThere is a problem, whenever I launch the app the posts are condensingAs soon I opened the Application, it started acting like weird.So far I like it, Twitter had way to many ppl but now this gives people a chance to get their work seen!wish you will add the feature of double tapping the icon on lower corner to switch accounts just like on IGGreat competitor for Twitter but to make it surpass twitter it has to give you the option to only see Threads from people you follow ... Don't want to see recommended Threads all over my homepageI love the interface, soooo smoothIt looks good but Video player needs more workNever used Twitter, don't understand how to use this app. UX needs improvement.for a new app I think it's awesome room for improvement as time goesWorse App I mean why doesn't work in low device it crashesLaunched without following-only timeline. Literally no point in following people because you'll rarely see what they have to say. Its dumb that you can't set your timeline on insta to following only at default but at least it's an option. Not interested in the features it has to offer.Twitter 2007 is what you get with this app. I want to know how to completely delete my threads account without deleting my Instagram.The Next Level User Experience 💯💯 Some features needed examples hashtags and trending searches Anyways change the social media Experience the next level 🎯It's like the new twitter! Love this app i can rant, i cant talk to friends thru threads!!Its a really nice app but i cant find my emojisA copy and paste of Twitter But then it's a really nice app And I love the fact that there's no dmIt's a good app, Still in the early stages but I would much rather use this than that other appThere is too much glitch.....you can't do anything here neither can see anything its just a blurred worldThis app is only for celebraties.... I post daily but no one follow me and not a single person like my photos ans threads.... So i gave a 1 star first you increase my followers than i rated fully.... Choice is yourNeed to add these feature 1. Trending 2. #Hastage 3. Edit Feature 4. Video lenght to hourCouple of days after launching and nothing is working.Feature to download photos would be nice.Cannot scroll without the app acting up.Trending Not available like Twitter! Need to improve!Great community on this app. A few missing features.I'm pretty new.. from today so I need to navigate the app and explore more.There's no option to switch your feed to only people you follow, leaving users bombarded with verified accounts and painfully corporate garbage being thrown in the feedSo many glitches and bugs . Please fix itWhat is wrong 😭😭 not working only crashed 😭😭Ehh. Basically Twitter w/o trends and I primarily use Twitter for just the trends. Probably will deleteAmazing 👏 I love this so much more than the blue bird lol.Triple 6 in logo, rip of Twitter crashes and no goodEverything is ok but, if chating people and collogue that is better❤️‍🩹I can't login. My thread Account failed to connect with my Instagram account. Any help?can you add a double checker when you unfollow someone because i accidentally did and its annoyingIf we want to delete this app or we have to remove our account our insta account will also get removed so pls add new account do not add your insta account in it and this mistake I have made that's why I am telling to you all pls check all rules then download itAs soon as i scroll the app glitches so bad it is not useableTrash, I got to have an Instagram? I never used that pedophile trash app!Buggy login experience but now I'm in. Much better platform than Twitter or Reddit at this point.No dm option, no trending or anything. Purely algo based. Waiting for the next updateBetter than Twitter. With neat and clean UI.3rd class copy of twitter...you just have people on instagram thats why it got famous or else as a thread alone app is not worth it...It's a great app but boring tbh. Hoping to improve it more!!Uploading is not working properlyApp caches a lot... You need to test the all more times...Great app! Excited for new features to be addedLove the UI and it's really smoothTimeline full of worthless celebrity and brand spam.I accidentally linked my account to it but sadly i can't delete my threads account without deleting my instagram account. Such a trashh appIt's crashing and having glitch.Just like twitter but one small issue, I can't download image directly in the appError - \"please wait before trying again\" Unable to log inNot working properly...facing many glitches.The Size Should Be little compressed ... And I Highly Recommend Makers To Make the feature which if any user want to delete his threads account then he/she Threads account only deletes , Not The Instagram account 🥺 As Insta is a emotion whereas threads is just launch....Lot of glitch, app is crashing.Give option to delete only thread account not insta else I'm going to file case against Instagram and threads will make sure to band it from IndiaIt's the exact same thing as twitter, but way less toxic and better vibe.There could be potential here, but for now it seems like a very poorly optimized twitterI download this app 3 times and still it not working on my phonePlease fix bugs... When I use it, it glitchesHorrible experience all around. Obviously too rushed with not much thought pit into itCrashed on one plus 9 pro latest os versionLooks cool, but it needs a lot of features.Hi please do well to add the edit options to post and tweetsIts ok, but needs a lot of more features that Twitter already hadThere are super glitches in my Xiaomi Mi A1 device. Please fix.Unable to login. Error pops up.Feels like Twitter and the UI is cool.... buggy ... every text and visual is glitchingI keep getting errors when trying to post images.Very bad app we cannot send any Massage or call To any gril so please invite Good base For massagesThe app is very good👍 but some more options should be added !Thread is a great app for organizing your Instagram messages with close friends. It has a clean and simple interface, and it's easy to use. It also allows you to share photos and videos seamlessly.This app use the usual restrictions and rules applied in FB and Instagram... But only for some people..I opened an account on the second day of the thread platform release. It's been eleven days since I've been using the Thread app. All very nice and interesting futures. Photo quality and video quality are very high, and very fast to use. Followers grow very fast, I like it very much. However, meta company should introduce chatting option in thread app and add some more futures.I have liked the app but more upgrades are needed like night theme 🙈🤔😭Love the smooth integration with my InstagramJust downloaded and it's already having issues posts won't load doesn't let me like or replySo far, so good.I like the layout and ease of useSo far so good. I like it. I have a question though, how do I disable autoplay of videos on the app?I like this app but this app is not dark theme on my phone please add dark theme optionHorrible app horrible interface generally bad.I hope there will be a translate button for those posts that are not in English. ☺️Offering no new features! What is the point of having another time wasting app?!I think if you add a message box, it will be very coolScreen flickers, can't use the appThere is nothing new . Full waste of time . Meta do something better . Instagram is far better than this cloneNice app but why am I unable to send threads to my friends via the app itself?All over super update hashtag system also I l like this application son upcoming sensational then second place go Threads first place comWe need more of features. Trending, hashtags.Nothing special than Instagram, I don't think it's necessary to keep this app other than InstagramWhat is this app trying to accomplish besides being a Twitter clone as soon as they started limiting users? Meta would rather jump in and create a new app for that scenario then go on about making their already existing platforms better. Guess blue checks sell more.Cool...The concept is good... We can login with insta ID and we can follow all our insta followers....within seconds we get an account like Twitter...We can't use hashtags pls make sure add hashtags too and improve some speedTerrible app, zero privacy, there's no way to delete it without deleting my InstagramIt's just Facebook but without the hashtags and messagingAmazing and very simple to useUpdate please for android it is not working anymoreFull of bots or people who apparently don't know how to say more than 1-2 words. There is absolutely 0 conversation happening and there is no way to see who I'm following. This was a completely half baked app that I'm almost sure it was forcefully published in the midst of Twitter having a crisis so they could try and gain some ground on Twitter. At the end of the day, both apps are terrible.It looks like Twitter and I don't really use my Twitter account cause it's difficult to handle 😭😭😭😭😭😭Didn't seems like good.why u both are practicing competition when both have big jaint company.we are tired to using thoseThis is totally wrong.. We don't get equal Opportunity in threads. I mean to say that i big creators who have already good amount of followers on instagram are getting more and more followers on thread due to your one function which is follow all yhe following list of instagram account. That not correct and equal competition for the new users who want to grow on thread. Please make change in this and give equal opportunity to all the users on threads platform. ThanksI'm sorry Threads. The algorithm is too boring. You push too much local content. The forced contents couldn't be more different from my taste. Twitter algorithm didn't push me local content. Twitter lets me see exactly what I want. After 2 whole weeks, I guess it's time to just quit Threads. The algorithm isn't worth it if all it does is push celebrity accounts, when I was never interested with them in the first place.I can't use it as i doesn't have insta gram account. Make it free for everyone.First app that I actually like that's made by Mr. \"Bark Barkerberg\". Btw this is better looking than Twitter. \"ELON MUSK\" : 0, \"Bark Barkerberg\" : 1This is a good app. With good user interface.There is a problem and it is the lack of hashtags. It is expected to be solved quickly. According to rumors, by deleting the Tradez account, the Instagram account will be deleted, which is also a fundamental problem and should be deleted.Really bad experience the app crash and broke downBug where instagram link not appear when visitting someone thread account, no 'recent activity' so you can't see liked or saved threadsAs I start scrolling, I just face glitch. Is this the new feature? How can I use this app?Verry good app , but lounch new features like trading sectionError logging in my log in works in instagram but not hereThe App always force close when I Start thread...🥲 Oppo Reno3 Android 12It's fun to use but maybe just make it as one thing in Instagram.Honestly... Twitter looks better and works better Needs a lot of workThis app is so annoying ive had tried to download it multiple times and it literally starts off extremely slow then once i get to a certain percentage it stops the download it has happened way to many times not only that i dont understand why not make it an extention or a part of Instagram INSTEAD OF MAKING A WHOLE DIFF APP its so stupid if ur gonna make a 2nd app at least make it well and fix its issues or let us sign in from a browser online instead of downloading it sense it doesn't even workVery simple UX, and Flow UI👏Whenever I want to upload a photo It's go back and said forced stop. What the heck is that..?Instagram already intresting app. same it is also. ❤️❤️It's applications are very poor it's looking like 🐦 twitter not a new platformEverything is good but need a DM button for the business that's will goodsame like Instagram but threads was looking like professional overall i liked ittimeline exclusively displays people i never followedTwitter rip off with slower performance and way fewer accounts.Convenient and easy to use. Amazing app. I like it..Nice features and easy to use.Threads App has redefined the way I approach productivity and collaboration. Its seamless task management, efficient communication features, smart notifications, and user-friendly interface combine to create a truly exceptional experience. Whether you're a professional managing complex projects or an individual looking to stay organized, Threads is the app you've been waiting for. Embrace its potential and unlock a new level of productivity in your life.It's a great app, definitely better alternative to the bird 🐦App is good make more flexible like stories share ,dmGreat idea, poor execution! I don't need to see every thread that everyone who has an accoun created, I have no interest in looking at random dogs and pictures of what a total stranger is eating for supper. I only want to see what people who share the same interests as me are posting. In other words... People I follow. App removed, maybe ill try it again some other time. That is when Meta gets their act together. This has a long way to go before it rivals Twitter and thats terrible at best.App is good, could use more features.Nothing productive just celebraties posting their story waste of time, Twitter is far betterApp crash when trying to upload 108MP picture from Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.Looks like made by 8 years old kid + I removed the badge number accidentally from my instagram profile & there is no way to put back so dumbVery bad app not working properly getting hangNot working while uploading images.As annoying as Instagram. Annoying more than TwitterThe time I'm spending in the app is unbelievable, love it so much🩵It's a good app for expressing a good note in insta storyI faced a glitch type screen in which i only see repeated icons on my full screenit was supposed to be a copy of twitter, but they copied it badlyStop showing me people whom I don't follow on my home page. Move that to a separate explore page or something.It's boring. I exit faster than InstagramI just want to see people i follow, instead they showing random stuf to see, what a dissapointmentNice functional app but Twitter is looks more authentic.Probably the best experience I've had on a social platform since the beginning of Facebook.Cannot disable video autoplay.I can't post any photos or video , when I try then I got try againHave to improve more, it's almost same as twitter.Great copy of twitter and instagram combined well done mark zuckerberg , it's awesomeI logged out of my thread account and can't seem to log back in again, 😔 so frustratingI need message like Instagram so I don't need to open other apps to share any threadsBetter so advance photos and videos download to show option please RequestOnly login through Instagram? I don't have Instagram so i can't use!Just a really bad Instagram wrapper. I doubt they even planned on making this before twitter outtage.I love this app ❤️ But i can't get my exact followers from Instagram When i achieve that, I'll rate five stars 😌App getting crashed everytime I open itdoesn't work properly. glitches a lotI've just installed the app and my home feed is nothing but accounts I don't follow. Why won't social media platforms realise that we don't want content shoved down our throats?Data collection is massive. Breach of privacy.. worst.I'm not interested in posts of people or businesses I don't follow. Would be nice to have a feature to turn this off.Doesn't work, freezes on home screenApp crashes when uploading photosSo far it's a great app. Far better than Elon Musk's Twitter. So much more going on and far less toxic posts or people on Threads. I feel much better having now gotten rid of TwitterSuch a nice app like twitter...amazing experience so far...excited to see what's nextLaunching an app in 2023 without themed icon support should be illegal, please update it.This app is awesome and please add photo save option and massenger opetionEven before 10 o'clock in the morning we used this app for more than 6 hours this app is a trap. future generation is in danger.🚫Crashing whenever I click on a thread to see replies.So far so good but it's taking forever to load the home pageNot working properly, display glitchWhenever I try to upload image app crashesYes, the app is quite good but a lot of things need to be improve.Not bad, the UI could be cleanerThere`s this glitch or bug or something that makes it impossible to use threads. All the pages overlap and when you try to scroll, the words duplicate themselves and you can`t actually see anything in the end.This app sucks... Please update it with all the features we are expecting.Simple and easy to use . Great experience . I am loving this😍Threads is understandable, Meta likely needs to expand the app's features, network, and customization over time to truly compete with the likes of Twitter, WhatsApp and other messaging platforms. The app in its current form seems fairly limited, so adjustments and additions will be needed for it to reach its full potential.just installed... keeps getting stuck and shaking...Amazing app, minimalistic interfacethere are no lists and it is very bad and there aree no listsGood application and very easy thanks mark....This app is really good just needs lots of updates to be the best and something better than tweeter.A good app but we are expecting something more interesting. Add something newI don't know what the problem is I can't log in. Please I need help.is popping up an error message 🙏It has a bug of overlapping please fix itKeep getting an error when trying to sign inNothing new 😞 I telling because I am the 1st Bangladeshi Who Log in to this app Zuckerberg copyed everything I guess Now he maybe 🤔 thinking Making A app like His own version of Tinder LOL. But meta is doing a great work Of copy pasteing Mark telling thread's dev that good Artist copy Great Artist Steal Mark you forgot to Steal You just copied Everything.This app is really cool and I downloaded it on 6th July at 5am.The screen starts to buffer asap i just touch the screenGood but hard to get followers Can't filter what u see But in all nice appThe app has a glitch with frames on frames ☹️There is a bug in the app , please improve it instagram teamCant tag anyone..If i tried to tag someone,the app is closing unexpectedlyneed more improvement loading or taking post is taking much time 🔥What if people dont want others know their instagram account? Why do i have a direct link to my instagram account in my profile? Whay can't i disable or remove it? Where is privacy?Fun, I guess, nothing bad has happened in my ten minutes using the appThere is a lot of room to improve but it is a good start though.It's now horrible! Absolutely horrible! Too much unnecessary restrictions, Zuck! I will give you one star for that.it was hard to login couldn't use itIdk y dis app can't deactivate account permanently. Twitter and threads. Wats going on?!Crashed repeatedly and it's filled with botsIt needs more development and more features.Good framework, needs features ASAPIt's a good platform to share something privately or publicly 🌸 awesome workAwesome app, yet not opening when l try log in.My app crashes when I try to post picturesBeing trying to post threads for 20+ hours now. But keeps saying it has failed. No customer support or where to reach to complaint.Mine is extremely glitchy i cannot even see the screenGlitches are there in Home feed I do understand it got launched right now but will take some time to make it better All the best teamNot optimized for my phone.....lots of glitches & bugsDefinitely, undeniably, one of the social medias of all timeNot able to upload pictures on AndroidNeed to be able to only see people I follow in my feed, there's too many accounts I don't care to see.Pretty chill. Barebones right now but full of potential 😎Not bad but still need more options to be cool, I hope in the next updates you will add more 😊good starting. it's possible to import all details from Instagram...Twitter is filled with fights, infidelity and people bashing on each other's interest. And while I know threads is in its infancy it could act the same way in the future. But for now threads is a much more calming and engaging platform with less hate in generalWe can't deactivate threads account, our Instagram account also get deactivated with threads account because they are linked. Plz separate themI think I'm the very first person to right this review...because I can't find any reviews yet lol...But I loved it ..threads ❤️❤️this is something amazing and fun to use.. Thank you Meta🔥🔥must add some switch accounts features so its getting good.It's annoying that I can't delete threads without deleting my Instagram ca. You guys please fix thisMy friend a/c not good it was becoming shaky shaky he can't use any way .i request to u please fix his a/c immediatelyAmazing experience, perfect app.Useless & a complete waste of timeA likeable app. But we need some more exiting featureEverything been going on well since day one till yesterday it stated telling me that, they restrictly certain activity to protect the community and it says I try again later,what could be the reason please help me( my handle is Sun bae -256.Awesome Surface And Easy To Use.Can't order chronologically or only see people you have followed.very fun, i hope people won't upload nudity and sexual stuff like twitter.It's actually a Nice platform... For those love.. Sharing information 🤍in wordsBoring!!!!! What's the point of an social media app if you wont get any response to stuff?Infinite scroll not working properly 😐😑Could have been better if so not interrelated to InstagramIt would be perfect if DM option is added.Can't upload pics. App closibg when uploading pics😕Not good at all, doesn't provides uh a dekstop or web version, crashes alot and made it so annoying that if uh join this then it's compulsory to have ur account activated otherwise if uh r gonna deactivate it, uh will end up loosing ur ig account too,as both of them would be deleted simultaneously. You'll end up regretting ur decision to create an account on this.Have no problems with it and like the setup, don't know why everyone else is complainingMy only gripe is I'm seeing mostly posts from people I don't follow on thread on my feed instead of accounts I do follow. I get it's connected to insta but I don't want to follow or see them hereThis app really good, but not showing badge on instagram bio 🥺It's nice, but I hope that celebrities give a chance to those with weak accounts to return to InstagramWas exited to try because, screw elon, but I'm not handing over all my data. Sorry can't do it.Can't upload photos on thread appPls add reels on threads & add to someone to mention option good app keep goingCan't logout and very bad tested appAlways bugs, log out many time.Keeps shutting down when I want to upload a photo 🙄🙄 Uninstalled twice 🙄Can we please have an option to open links in the default browser instead of the custom browser?It's a great app you can have many friends I lovee itt💋This really needs daily app updates or else it gonna lose lot of active usersI'm loving the App Why you can't save pics on the App like Twitter or post any nudes on the App We need these issues fixVery bad app I want to delete my account in this app but I can't bcz of insta pls fix this bugg #I like this application ❤️💥💯, Fantastic features. Twitter wali feeling, Instagram wali audience 👏🏻Bug redmi note 8. Suddenly glitches everywheregood app so far just needs the switch account optionFor a brand new, its very well optimized, its like twitter😘The app needs a functional hashtag search feature!I really had bad experience at the very beginning, the UI is good and understandable but whenever I tried posting pictures it always crashes for no reason. Please can we have a quick fix for this?App get crash....not working properlyDoesn't allow login without Instagram account.Installed to check it out, saw there was no way to filter by people you follow (seriously, that's a pretty basic feature). Super bare bones imo and really no different from Twitter and that includes the toxicity. I stick with Mastodon and the fediverse.Hands down one of the best social media apps out right now. No bugs on launch. There are some improvements/new features they need to and are planning on adding but it is great.So nice to finally have a good substitute to Twitter. Basically the same but better.Threads is a best social media platforms many best features I love itits good for 1st time.. but can you just give us the access for couple account? like instagram doesSo far, lots of things I loved about Twitter. A few suggestions: 1) a following page. If I can't see posts from folks I follow, what's the point of following? 2) hashtags so I can find content I love and folks who love mine can find meerror when load then home. its stackingGreat App from Instagram, Minimal but Stylish 👀🙌🏻Add option to turn off auto playMissing bookmarks, DMs, switching between multiple accounts and the trending hashtags explorer.....Excellent app but plz change logo then it looks goodIn love with the UI design... Already addictedit's Very Good App like Instagram make early account to take your Namewhy does the app keep crashing when posting?I think you should add double tap to like ❤️ feature 😉I love this app, but can you plz add translationI like it very much but I am having one problem with it .I have tried so many times to uptade my bio but the threads just tells me 'we are sorry, but something wrong. Please try again.' Please look into the matter.Crashing way to much when writing posts and comments. 👎Give us the option to hide posts from people we don't follow and a way to look for posts OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME PAGE / FEED both here and Instagram THEN we'll talk.Unable to set username. All usernames are unavailableNeed some improvements and specially Dark ModeJust amazed with the interfaceA pretty mid twitter app. Can't wait to see it failNot working properly at allI cannot download it to my laptop. Apparently I can only log into it on my phone with Instagram? Big fat fail for me. I'm already over it.Needs improvement and speed.Completely laggy with many glitches! I'm using a Mi note 6 proMurge this threads in instagram like reel button...... It seems like we are using two same instagram accounts in different appsMany issues in this app bugs and login problem.Garbage app. Lasted 15 minutes on my phone before I uninstalled it.Simple new way to get in contact with the public, or not...It's good but stopping please fix this fault overall it's goodA lot better and its just a start of Threads, they're gonna improve it more, just stay tunedSecurity detected this app attempting to access my banking apps. CORRUPT and UNSAFE app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!Needs a translation featureWhy is my timeline showing accounts I don't even follow? I don't want suggestions. This cannot replace twitter.crashes when I try to click on a post - pixel 6 android 13Love the interface but the app keeps on crashing. I also opted not to sync my instagram contacts to threads so I can have a fresh start of choosing who to follow but it keeps on suggesting/showing too many accounts in its home tab.I can't open my instagram apps if my account is connected to this appI just downloaded this app but when i scroll down it just like glitches and i cant see anything so plz fix thisI like the threads app for meta, but I am concerned it could share the wrong data. Is there a way to make sure it doesn't leak any secure data, gps info, or location to that closed social media site, Mastodon. This way I and anyone else with a Instagram account can be comfortable using it alone side Instagram for fashion, photography, and gaming? I want to give it a try, but that social media site made me uncertain if I should use it. Thank You.The app keeps closing whenever I try to upload a photoI don't know what to say but I need to say something THIS APP IS AWESOME it have insta ui and twitter mixed I like this appFeels like an exact copy of twitter to me but kinda cool !!You should also give an option in this application that anyone can download their photo or video from here.Constantly crashes when tagging peopleEnable multiple accounts login and thanks for removing reels. 🙏UI is disbalanced in vivo phone And app is goodUnable to open the app!I think this new feature app will be more better if y'all add \"mutual\" or see people who follows you back🤗This is not best application for Instagram reel creators Because algorithm is not same A reel creator upload reel on Instagram and get audience what he do in threads How to they get audience in threads ?This app a lot of work to be done on it so it will be better has Twitter e.t.c pls work on the message boxVery dead application not working properly.☹️☹️😠😠😡The app is good and all but why android users can't download pics from the app? Fix it pleaseIt’s have lot of issues. I think it’s need more care to fix of themThe app is crashing suddenly please fix this 😭 aside from that I like this appPlease fix , any in android version have bug when scroling thread 🙏Is this supposed to replace Twitter?? 😂😂 Lmao 🤣😂 very unresponsive app, makes you feel like your screen is damagedSucks so far. I only want to see accounts I follow and 95% of my feed are people I've never heard of or don't care about following. I'll try later if/when they fix this.Creative idea .. easy to use .. simple .. it will be revolutionaryI have just downloaded it and I think it will be a great competitor of TwitterIts crashing sometimes when i open replies to a threadAfter a day of installation, not my Instagram nor the Threads working!!Only one feature need to be updated that is share our profile to othersFinally an update that fixes my issues. ThanksNothing new, no uniqueness just like a clone of Twitter but a cheap versionIts not stable,its double of everything😭😭😭For now it's ok , but wait what ?? A ton of personal information collection???My thread is full of stuff I have zero interest in. I have to scroll down and mute tons of rubbish before I get to anything I followNo way to create account rather than Instagram login.Great experience people need app like this thank you so much team lots of love ❤️Good need more updations except the reel buttonThe latest dataminer app that collects so much data it puts the FBI to shame. Trying to delete threads account literally deletes the associated Instagram accountconstantly bugs out, unusable for nowFirst to review in my language... Nice app Twitter like but cooler and betterIt keeps hanging.I cant use it smoothly!It can't have message option، couldn't see profileApp crashes everytime I attach photo.Love this application 💙 first day first Login that's a amazing feeling, best wishes for future threads 🤍 go AheadAttempted to sign up, and my account was immediately blocked!Trash Trash Trash!!! Let us delete this app! Holding us hostage by linking it to our Instagram page.Laggy n buggy ...it needs to be fixed ..it's glitching a lot everything is overlaped to eachotherNice application, but I hope that I can return my threads account number in the Instagram bio, because I deleted it and I cannot return itWoul suggest adding an option to save photos and videosAnother left wing controlled app. I'm deleting and uninstalling. 🗑️This is cool, could we save photos to gallery tho 🙇‍♀️🙇‍♀️It has a lot of problem with persian (farsi) language but except that one thing , it's incredibly goodI like this app so far. It needs a dark mode option.So far, so good. The engagement far exceeds other social platforms, just in the first day I'm using it.Its good but needs improvement and its too similar to twitterNeed alot of work, numbers of posts, tags, etcBad app Can't open a new account on this app I recommend don't be install this worried appLooks cool! It should replace the twitter.All good but i need App for pc and Laptop. Please give me a app in Microsoft storeText Translator feature is neededNot sure but maybe after. 5 years he will be the biggest app like TwitterMy early comment and this app will makes so many unemployed people life better and provide a source of income so. I reviewed for a great appThis is one of cheating app and there is no free speech, etc...Good app need more features and monetization to creatorGood concept, will update rating once I can scroll.When I enter this app it starts tremor. I can't use itI like this app. Especially UI and B&W colorIt is not working well..it hangs..Good app moreover I like the black and white themeIt is better if the messaging system is enabled in the software.💬Not working full of glitches in ui.Photos failed to upload, reason not known? What to do?This is not at a unique app it is just cntrl + c and cntrl +vI couldn't even see my timeline it glitches like hell but I like the ideaQuite fascinating and addictive User interfaceVery good app entertaining , knowledgeable, interesting..Very Nice app. The app is very familiar like I've been using it for years.Its an amazing app .. congratulations Instagram ✨ but i still love insta more 💗It's needs more improvements to look pretty and warmYou can't only see stuff from people you follow, it desperately wants you to see Ellen DeGeneres and Eurovision posts and there's no way to switch that off. It's like what if Twitter only had a For You tab and was run by the second worst person in the world instead of the worst person in the world.When I open the app I get graphical glitches with the textI'm just scrolling it and checking it, till know it looks good.I can't get in. I don't have an Instagram account and never wanted one.I can't open this app... Showing lots of bugsIt's gd, I just didn't like the fact that celebrities brought their followers and now looks exactly like InstagramLove it, about time, let the bird fly away adios goodby.There should also be a section that shows top trends.The app has a lot of potential, but it's a great start.fix your app asap. it glitches so bad itll cause epilepsy. i also dm'd this on insta to threadsapp. so you better answer that to see how bad it glitches(acc: dem0s.privv502)Fix the glitchy screen as first as possible 😡I love the karma bots giving the app glowing reviews like they do with every app no matter how bad or outdated it is. I can't use Threads on Tablet or log in. It's not ready for Android. Besides the only way to close your threads account is to delete your ig account as the two are linked. Other option is to create a new ghost ig account just to use this app.Crashes every 10 minutes or so on Android 12, MIUI 13Home page crashed as soon i opened the applicationSo far, so good. Simple and easy to use!Sadly just more Meta garbage. Censoring and jailing galore as is the standard with Facebook community \"standards\". The figures quoted of all the millions of new users to the platform is completely inaccurate as 99%+ are already Instagram users so this is hardly anything to brag about NEW USERS 👎🏻 I registered a new account to test Facebook and Instagrams \"standards\" and was immediately blocked with 6 months to appeal. Total bogus rubbish built with Copy & PasteDoes not have hash tag search option. You can't search trending hashtag. Trending hashtag must be there.. Poor Copy of twitter.when I try to upload photos.its close without any reasonIn my device crash app while im typing thread. Why?Its nice and very loving app My question is this,how do we message each other and talk to each other over thereDownloaded and linked an account from Instagram and the threads app caused my Instagram app to crash within seconds every time I tried to open the app. Uninstalling the threads app fixed all the Instagram issues I was having. Wild considering it's all one metamess, you'd think it would play together well...The Codeword is the only one I can find for Tahir is the only way for usAwesome option this is. Everyone like it. Just awesome. And thank you for this option or App 🤗Very smooth and optimized app than TwitterDespite Hiding word like Crypto and NFT, i still het related pages and posts containing those words. With twitter the mere mention of ganes would gift me pages that post things related to that, but threads gives me celebrities i dont know, influencers and cryptbros. Please make it more user friendlyPlease include following feed feature and save feature in this appIt's easy to used this app. No hassle nice one Meta to develop this app.Completely devoid of Twitter blue virgenes, and their moronic takes. I'd give it 10/5 if I could. 👏🏽 💯Glitching up so hard right now made a screen recording if u need i can emailOverall, Threads is a well-designed app that offers a more personal and private way to connect with close friends and family. However, it is still in its early stages, and there are a few features that are missing, such as the ability to search for specific text or phrasesDon't make an account if you intend to delete it after because this app doesn't provide that. Once you make an account, you won't be able to delete the account completely without deleting your ig account. Home algorithm also meh, this app doesn't care to ask what your interests are. They just shove all accounts to your home even though you don't follow anyone. This app also put that @numbers to your bio, which annoying and can't be hidden. I really hate my decision to make account, deactivatedI thought this app was ok and I'd like to see how it can be improved in the future. As of now what I really want is a curated feed or a following feed, I don't see why we can follow people if we won't see their posts if we're not online 24/7. I saw a lot of marketing for this as an app for artists but it hard to support people when you can't see what they post. With some improvements in accessibility and content I could see it being a good app that I'd use.need for features like able to add gif, able to see how many people reposted, how mamy people views the post, and so onWow 😲 very good features ☮️👍 nice Thank you so much dear instagram and threads team ❤️Many glitches like overlapping screens and it feels like your device is deaderror in log-in? I'm not even log out my account. What is happening? there is other account which is changing my password? Like? seriously?Unable to upload an image.Crashes a lot - Not user friendlyI love Meta App. Its a fastest and trending apps everyone uses it . Love u metaThe app have alot of bugs i can even use it at this pointIt won't let you delete your account without deleting your instagram!Its great, but the search function only allow to look for people and I would suggest if the search function can also look for post, picture, hashtag and other results as well. On the other hand, I've got so much thread about korean/kpop/idols that I have actually muted the user as well as words (kpop related words) but they're still appearing. Appreciate if could improve on the muted function as well. Thanks Meta dev team.I have installed today It's looks like instragram twitter alternative app, I don't know how was that my experiencetimeline is just random people I'm not interested in or follow, what's the point?Has potential but deacvitating until I can curate my feed. No point in going to check in on people when they get buried under thousands of people and celebrities I don't know and don't care to follow or see what they're saying.I am facing an extreme UI glitch in my Android phoneNeeds some more years to be perfect.Keeps crashing. Can't postIt's some error to watch some videos.It's the best public app. It's really better from Twitter!Probably the worst app by meta so far. The app is glitching out big time and laying over texts that it looks possessed. Can't even see anything, would add pictures if I could just to show how horrible it is.Clean, refreshing but confusingThis app is so osm for more information about my knowledge 🫡👍 & very easy to login 🥳🥳👏👏 too goodWhy doesn't it have private inbox?? It looks nice but on the feed we should just be seeing posts of people we followAllow users to register on the app without necessarily having to operate Instagram. The current model is intrusive. It hard to anonymously use your app like one does on twitter. Delink registration from Instagram. That's the primary reason why I uninstalled the app without registering. You're making it very easy to trace peopleThis apps is one of the best latest app for advertisingA trending topics tab would make a great addition to the appHybrid of Twitter & Instagram please try to change interface 🥲The moment I finished my login, the threads(?) on the page immediately overlap with each other. Same goes on search page, profile, and notification. So it create some kind of ripple threads. I wish this review page have a way to post my screenshot to explain it better. I hope you can improve that and I'll change my review the moment it works for me.Great app but it should have a trends for you clickNeed to improve interfaceNeeds a search that display hashtags or threads about a topic. Also needs an account switcher like Instagramcould be better than twitter but lacking basic features that make it worseYou can't just simply rely on instagram influences. App totally sucksConcept doesn't really work well, just a worse TwitterIts not good at all. Thread creator should have to work on this app thanks. Regards andrew tate fanThe people complaining about the censorship forget that this is a company, and companies run based on capitalism, so they will do what they have to inorder to keep advertisers. Aside from that it's working well so far, I just block what I don't wanna see and curate my timeline to myself simple as that.U have a very bug's please solve this problem bugs problem...The app glitches alot while scrolling.Add inbuilt Bookmark feature to save, a thread or post within app , so that we can check it out somewhereI have been use Instagram since 2016 but none of my reels have gone viral till date.Since the day I have downloaded this thread my instagram is lagging too much, I am unable to open my instagram 😡We need freedom of speech, DM options, hastags and trending topics.please bring the translatation to the captions and replies.Meta you are genius, you just copy all the Twitter's features without hard working.Too Much Bugs Screen is FlickerringOk first why this app glitches a lot? Like I can't even scroll the screenBest app but no language translate future available...It's new really good app 😀 but Elon musk, Twitter master copy😹just for fun .❤️ love app❤️Twitter uses to be enjoyable until it is handed over to Elon Musk who made some unnecessary changes that force people to need its substitution. As the results, many quit Twitter including me.Good application but option to translate instagram threads should be given pleaseSuchit told me about this app, i was shocked about what it was, haha twitter will bear a bit loss...Poorly executed alternative to Twitter... Typical Instagram/Facebook \"forced algorithmic feed\"...So far so good. Add more features and it will be the best.I can't wait to leave Twitter... But why do I need an Instagram account? I'm an old millennial - can't you just include an email sign up instead to win this market share battle?App got an update and fixed everything.The best app rather than Twitter!! I love it and need to improve somethingTime taken to reach 1 million users: Netflix - 3.5 years Twitter - 2 years Facebook - 10 months Spotify - 5 months Instagram - 2.5 months ChatGPT - 5 days Threads - 1.5 hours (king 👑)It's don't allow to share videos ...It is not good 😕eehh fine app eh looking really sharp looking good look at your app shinyPoor copy of twitter, so many features lackingEasy sign up, easy invite to friends!Unable to add images.Please 🙏🙏😌More Updated this app Recover Post option Not Available, & Edit option not Available, more Improvement.Imma rate this for the future to see date downloaded 7-07-23 app review so far soo good mark and elon musk supposed to have a fight but ended at mark making this app to rival the twitter elon have 😩😩Overall a Good app Need Reel section for this app Add the gif option for Google boardit keeps glitching. I can't even scroll down?Wow this very nice 👍 I love it 💕 this but chenging tha app logo and name please #Zuckerberg sir can you chenging sirgood app. need black theme need to show trending hashtagsGood for threads (another tweets). Need more features.Unable to use dragging issueSuper aap easy access user friendlyProvide an (accept all / confirmed all ) option to accept followers request for open account on treads like Instagram ( anyone can follow open account without admin confirmation). If an account have followers in thousands or millions then what will he/she do ? . Should he/she click on confirm option for thousands or millions times to accept followers requestMuch needed solace from the bird experience....I like this app. However, can you just give me one more chance to unhide the Threads badge on instagram, please 🙏🏻🫠It's really beautiful I love it so much but I hope it doesn't stop workingThere is a bug i found after I opened and refresh itI'm loving it there, i know there are more to come. It's already peaceful and easy to useKeep crash, ada fitur autoclosenya? HahaThe app crashes whenever I open itI can't know how to use it but it is from Instagram well it can do something like Twitter ✊Clean ui, but sometimes its failed to load someones threadsLol, experiencing using this apps, and couldn’t getting code.Absolutely fun to scroll for hours and hours!In this app, you can't control the video and the pictures. Even the data saver doesn't work. Please, there should be a \"never auto autopkay \" and also hide or reduce the pictures qualityWould give five if it didn't keep closing when I'm trying to type a post!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I DON'T have an INSTAGRAM account. Finding difficult to login.Great app, user-friendly, approachable vibes, and straight-forward on use. I prefer the approach of this more than that 'bird app'. Although I have a request, please enable app cloning and/or multi-account log-ins, thank you! And utomatically hiding like counts is faulty.Similar to Twitter, but 1- No option to create new account (just connect with insta) 👎 2- Cannot delete threads account without deleting Insta Account. 👎 3- No Hashtags 👎 4- No trending Stories 👎 5- No Chat /Personal Messages section 👎 Simply going to uninstall threads. Bye bye 👋One of the best apps thank you Meta for the ease of working with threadsBuggy at the moment, I've not been able to post pictures.It was working well, but now my followers ain't showing on my profile, and I can't see other people's followersI know it's still messy. But, hopefully we can get a tl/nf thing where we can only see mutuals or threads we follow.I thought this would be nifty and I would be able to create an account. Surprise! Unfortunately, that was not an option as my phone number was required that signified I already \"have an Instagram account with that #.\" I did not want to connect to that account and I REFUSE TO SIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK. SCR3W YOU ZUCKERBERG!I didn't find anything unique. Just an old design.Alot of time I reported my thread app not working. I still facing the problemGood, Hopefully it will be better than twitter but hashtag system should be includedIts good experience to threads and good effort for meta team but this step might be crucial more in future but i have confident on you that you will be consistent on your goal❤It's a great app . But it should have live broadcast.Its name should be Changed like , Hey hi or easy typeIt's fun, until it's having a bugyou can't easily switch between ur accounts, there's no soft-block featureNeed some updates 1. Switch profile 2. Upload videos 3. Make its own settings 4. Feel like Insta so need some updates to make its different @Threads pls work on it 🤞🙏it's a ten but there no translation T.TReally good app, ngl. we just need DM!!!It's a good app. It's not as optimized as Twitter yet, and that's fine. You can't expect Disney+ to be Netflix since day 1. Twitter has perfected their craft since over a decade now, and they still keep destroying it.The app can't be used without Log in with InstagramAt first, I used this app, everything was okay. But, yesterday, when I wanted to open my account, it said that someone had logged out my account and said that maybe the owner had changed the password. I never logged out and changed the password. Hope you have a solution to this issue. I don't want to lose my Instagram account because of this.I'm satisfy with this app I mean it's a new app but I feel like I use this app from so long thank you meta.It crashes when I type more than 5 words.I'm not a big fan of it because it locks up and doesn't update.While it's not Twit-ler, it's still Meta. I'll give it a spin if only to stick my finger in Elon's eye.It is a good app but it glitch ing on and from startupI downloaded the app but it wont work smoothly on my phone and my andriod is version 9 which means it compatible for it. But any time i want to scroll through the feed the writeup get clumsy together and the text and images start shaking...how can i rectify this problem?Oh my god 🤣🤣🤣 damn it.... Twitter and threads like to same of lag performance...hmm not interested by threadsSimple and less bloatedPerfect for anyone who wants their private info taken, their behavior modified, and their thoughts censored. Just look at the permissions list and read some news about how Facebook censors people just for disagreeing with the government or large businesses. If you use this app you are volunteering to be part of the system.Good app but it's working against twitter so there is no improvement.Good app 👌 Nice UI , nice features 🤗Competitionk is fine, cheating is not It’s all about Ctrl C and Ctrl V..If you want share your ideas with text and present you point of view you can use this appVery good app We need just a message optionVery nice app i have grow 🪴 this app i think Manny reward please take Manny every users thank you God bless you alwaysThis app is glitching for me and I cannot see anything properlyThis is the new app of Instagram, competitor of twitter. Elon musk vs Mark Zuckerberg ...What a rivalry!!The more you praise this app, the less it is because its features are amazing.Doesn't work. Display is corrupt.I can' t signup new account, need to install instragram something.Am I really the first one in the world to write a positive review on this app!!! Love it! It's a love at first sight 🤩😍Threads is as nice as Instagram...!!Twitter lookalike minus some features like DMs, explore, views etc. Your feed will have more content from people you don't follow. Basically people/brands with the blue tick! The reach, algorithm must be on trial phase rn & won't be surprising if it favours influencers! It would have been good if there was segmentation of threads to keep track, given it's marketed as conversation app. As it will add more features, it'd soon become another Twitter. You won't miss anything if you aren't on it.same content and user base as on insta, what the difference of using this app???Many bugs and glitches in this app please fix itAttempt to increase Instagram users. I won't be signing upApp permissions more intrusive than a colonoscopy, way too many ads and was shown toxic content. If Instagram is cocaine than Threads in meth. I was hoping for better but got shown the worst parts of IG. Couldn't delete this app fast enough. Unlike Threads, Mastodon is advertising free, run by non-profit groups and doesn't track you like a parolee with a GPS ankle bracelet.When I download it and want to enter the application, it tells me that the application has an update, or the application is updating ????It's working for someones favor! And 100% copied from Twitter!It's full of glitches and errorsIncredible application just it needs some featuresIt crash when trying to add an image to my threadsIt lags a bit. Very basic But it's new.this new meta app is very use full please add reals option in this app ❣️It's meta and there's no desktop accessVery nice app, but can anyone tell me how 🤔 to unhide the ID in insta???????Decent app so far would like a option to edit posts after postingPlease bring messaging options and chat themes.the app is rather performant and feels like Instagram. But nice app.Just include hashtag & Trending features. It will be better than twitterMuch better than Tw(a)tter, the blue bird😸😸😸Love this app Instagram account @inspired.version @motivated.bible @motivated.scriptureBest option for sharing knowledge with public on social media.It's good but missing a lot of featuresLittle Bugs on push notification and followA very great app 💞💞.... Fast and reliableUrdu language is missing in this app please add itAll the post are overlapping its like an hallucination worst app .It is a good app, there are no problem and bugs.So far, I like this application. It could use some features like gifs, maybe live stream etc. The tweets aren't repetitive as you scroll your feed, unlike Twitter, and it seems as though you can see everyone thread who posts on the platform, which is cool. Makes following new people easier. So far so good. I'm a meta Share holder too so with this new app I'll be buying more stock options. Lol❤️😀😁Best Features And Services , I Love ItLot of bugs in login Followers are dead Which is not active automatically get 150 followers without any close friendsWorst experience ever. They are trying to replace twitter but they didint even try to facilatate .There is a bug. Its like infinite words...Facing a glitch.... Just not working... Kindly do somethingWorst app, 😭 fully glitched screen.Works like charm. Need seperate login feature.so sweet threads an i always support this app in any condition so thankyou very muchCan't log in without an Instagram accountThe feed need to be the people I followed only but overall it's a great appHi, I'm the first person who rates the new instagram (Thread) a better place to discuss.Need to switch between multiple accounts. Need post translation.Post cannot be edited and I can't see those not following back or not following. But the app beWhen I open this app, my display starts blinkingIf it had the ability to hashtag and space like Twitter, it would be great.Unable to receive an OTP for forgotten PWD. Check this part please. If you wish to compensate me for this finding please reach out.nice app. meski fiturnya masi terbatas, i'll stay pasti kedepannya bakal updateIt's so sleak and smooth. I love it.Nice but add a trending page and hashtagsNice app best app 100 by 100 threads And Twitter app is so cheap 100 by 8.5really disappointed with this app didn't enter app and fully bugIts good but by mistake i logged out my account and now I'm unable to log in again 🙁🙁Had more glitch 😔😔😔 Can't even open the appCan you add the translation feature? Also, when I search for something I don't want accounts, I want threads or hashtagsThe app is too smooth , DM's should be introduced alsoThe app is great but not for those who have the version below android 9,, cause whenever I try to open the app.The app's home page becomes glitchy and scramble,, So this is a matter of regret to the meta authority that they should have be more senciere before launching the app,, though its a bug associated problem,,,,Really need to put download photo featuresLook like tweeter Small brother . But good in experience I prefer Threads . Rivalry on 🥶Love this app! I prefer it to Twitter. Thanks Instagram/Meta!This app work very slowly it's not like insta or FacebookI think this platform is contivity with Instragram but here no options for story upload and others.so this is using like Twitter and we threads here like our thoughts or other 👍Can not make a 1st time account, it just ask me to sign in using Instagram that I do not have on my phone, SO HOW TO MAKE A ACCOUNT?????After downloading threads,my insta account is not opening since yesterday evening.This is amazing,app that Way better than Twitter,hope y'all added good thingsUnintuitive UI. Restrictive functionality. Content basically mirrors Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. This is not exciting and new, it's just a business venture! Same old social media yawnfest. When is somebody actually going to break the mold and make something fresh?Very buggy, I can't view my pageThere's is a huge bug in this app . Everything is just jumbled I don't know how to explain it .Its a very cheap app dark mode are not supported 😒Loved the minimalistic interfaceThe app is crashing many timesInclude hastag and trending option in search barNot working in Android pie (9)It is a ripoff twitter it looks and feels the same as twitterI'll continue using instagram and WhatsApp cause they're good but Threads is not fun to use, rather use twitterThe app still needs work. All I see on my home page are blue checkmarks and random influencers and brands I am not interested in. It gives the vibe being a twitter only for brands not a place for normal people. It would be great if posts were in chronological order and only see the people I follow and to include a trending page. With all the issues twitter is facing this app is still far from being a twitter replacement.Exactly like Twitter in a sense of posting thoughts, feelings, memes, and promotions, but different in a sense that I have yet to see any pop culture drama, I have yet to see any discrimination, or cyber-bullying. Threads is safe so far!!Brilliant, I'm glad there is something better than Twitter available to use.App is crashing when I try to post pictureNew and exciting for a change from the twitter bipolar energy.Tldr: Twitter 2.0 by Instagram Great app, I won't use it very much thoughAll Good But Please Make Space Option Like Twitter.Every time I try to post a new Thread post with a new pic, I get kicked out. EVERY TIME. It's BS.This is very osm app ..plz launch the feature of trending hatstag etcInstagram account homepage has been dysfunctional post installing and creating a profile on this app.This App is one of the most wonderful App were I can be me without be Sher I love this App but the only question now is Who is the third3 person to be on this thread App please 🙏🙏It has twitter and Instagram mixed vibes, i like it.This app is garbage doesn't even open most of the timeNeed many changes. The GIFs are to be added.The only problem i had has been solved thank u souch meta. Shows your awareness towards your usersVery buggy... the feed wont loadWorst than Twitter that's for sure. Alot of critical feature for an social media are non existent. Like seriously, this ain't the 2000s anymore, and sure as hell this ain't facebook, stop putting random people's post in my tread that I didn't follow, it's just worst than advertising. I will only come back once you guys implement a \"core\" feature such as being able to view your following people's post first like Instagram or make it as a seperate page in Twitter. Jeez old man...Very slow when browsingChat options not available Its very badI want a standalone app. Not another data sucking child of Facebook!It's a good and interesting app but this app is child of Instagram 😂It's crashing when attaching photosuch a buggy app... videos don't play soundsLooks nice but seeing people on my feed I don't follow is why I left Facebook. I follow people for a reason because I only care about what they say.Like twitter but with less bots, less creeps, less nazis, less scams, less pdf files.Dreadful. Functionality clearly needs more months of testing. No DMs. When writing a message you have to manually scroll the tab down to see what you're typing. No trending or subject matter. Its just literally your newsfeed, which is a disorganised mess and filled will memes and crude behaviour. Nothing value additive. It's a glorified version of Insta. Pass.We have to keep in mind that its the initial stage of the app ,there will be bugs glitches ,and crashes. But one thing we can't deny man this blew up ,like people rushed to threads like ,fathers rush away to get milk (kidding) but the best thing about this app is no cheap theatrics like you can basically buy blue ticks (for a monthly subscription) [musk-the-mugger]. Its a platform where verification will have a value and importance not like Twitter.This is amazing, because unique and attractiveNo web version and we must have Instagram in order to use it that is BS and the functionality wise very basic version of Twitter.. At least try to accommodate some of the great feature of Twitter,and call it Beta version to stop getting bombarded with the negative reviews. Good luck,Zuke.App is a simple clone of Twitter. I just wish that people I DON'T FOLLOW stop popping up my threads.Well designed, easy to use, but it's refusal to allow any content that could be labeled \"nsfw\" makes it an easy pass as a true Twitter alternative. Political or personal opinions aside, without some sort of option to allow content in that category, it will continue to needlessly kneecap it's self. No normal person is going to use both apps, and way more then are willing to openly say it will continue using Twitter for this reason alone.Some issues needed to be fixed for better experiencetoo many bugs , but i still love this apps.This app is really great, anyway How do I translate other languages ​​to English? Is there an option for that in the app?It's really cool I can't understand it a bit But it is very cool I really loved it 🤩Why don't you give us an option where we can see the posts of people only we follow and not n number of random meaningless stuff in which we are not interested at all?Threads (Tweets) loading is very slow 😞Extremely poor. Just copied twitter. World don't need this app.U should get emoji's on the like button like on facebook it would help us alotHiii, could you please add the See the translation, thankyouI thread to download on my infinix hot 10 but didn't openOn the search Icon, there's no way to know what's trending. Can you work on that?10 / 10 feels good, keep up the good work guys!Too much data collected without reason.I am very sad . Chatting features is not available 😭. How can talk to friends 😔. And Now am very upset 😤Good application bt we need more features like massaging n othersIt was soooo cool frr 2 use this new app It really seems like Twitter tho !! I'm just picturing the reaction of Elon Musk 😹not optimized for rtl languages!It's not too shabby, i love it. Take all my data ZuckyIt's OK but it's crashes to muchWonderful 😊 but black screen bugVery bad experience, App not tested properly, after login everything starts to jitter on the screen everything overlapping please improve this, because instagram works perfectly fine on my phone but in threads i cannot read a single word also after login, because screen continues flickering and splashing, i cannot post screenshots here otherwise would have postedA really good alternative to Twitter. Meta taking over social media one app at a timeCrashes every time I select textsNice but the data charges are highThe app takes too much personal data to run an app.Terrible ui, buggy , slow,When they first revealed the app, we thought it had potential. But it took only 5 minutes to see that.... NO. It's really just Instagram for tweet-like texts, and, like Instagram, it shows random people all the time. It really doesn't try to do what Twitter does, it's just InstagramWhen install the screen is blurred like when I scroll the posts are overlappingI give it four because threads are getting back after I viewed it 😮‍💨 but almost it's a great app n the best app used 🤞🫶Very good. Not alternate for Twitter its another More than TwitterForce close when uploading an imageIt sucks tbh. Logged in here using one of my Instagram account idk why that account isn't working anymore.Cool apps, but I can't uploading pictures.Not stable continusly lacking over screenThere's no delete option and if I had to want to delete my thread account I also have to delete my Instagram account. This wasn't expected from metaI used redmi note 5 pro. In my phone it doesn't worki really enjoy to use threads 🔥❤️😚 team Meta thanks 😊❤️ you for launching this app.Hi team This app is laging on my phone freezing pitcher and text please help me out thankxOkay app is pretty good but definitely needs work.Can't sign up, only allows sign in with Instagram....It works, but the home feed is nothing but strangers talking about stuff I don't care about. I would prefer to just see posts from the people I follow. That's why I follow them. I like the lack of a trending tab, but I see no point in using this app until the home tab is cleaned up and we get a followers view.There's a bug guys whenever I try to open my recent Follower first thread the app closes on its ownIts not working and glitchingNice app. I hope there's a way to see posts we heart-ed.It's not working properly please try to fix itVERY NICE BUT PLEASE, ADD A SWITCH ACCOUNT OPTION!!!!This is a poor imitation of Twitter. The app isn't good and it isn't fun at all.Device model Asus Zenfone Max Pro m2 :app is lagging, ui is getting overlappedThis is a great app but please fix the glitching 😊I have had to report a system failure three separate times and I haven't received any response. I have also noticed that comments on my threads have been reported but I'm not the one that has reported them. Either I've already been hacked (it's only been about a week) or there's a lot of glitches that need to be fixed but either way I'm really frustrated with the fact that nobody has gotten back to me or even attempted to fix my problem.Wanted to spite Elongated Muskrat, instead forced to sign up for Instagram just to log in, instead of just a regular sign in prompt, not even a Facebook or Google sign in option. Y'all need to learn from PC gaming that no one wants a dozen different launchers or logins for something as simple as this.It has no Dark and Light Mode optionsHopefully it will make a place in people's minds as an alternative to Twitter. I downloaded it last night. I will give the rest of the review after use.I Have Few questions we can't use the HashTag Here.❓ can't we use the Dark mode? and can we see the quote posts. Seems No⁉️Great app, I feel more comfort here than Twitter. I also logged in the app. Uncle Zuckerberg was a famous poet that's why he brought these crazy apps to the marketGreat start for a new platform.Scrolling speed is very lowVery Nice .. but can you make the app ato rotateI love how fluid this app was, why don't do the same thing with Instagram tho..Bugs bugs bugs everywhere there's bugsI would like to see posts of people I FOLLOW, others...not really. Also can we have dark theme.So I have to have Instagram to be able to log in and use this?? No thanks, you can go get fu@#ed! I'm out!!! UninstallingAs of launch there is no way to sort your feed chronologically and no way to show just people you follow on your feed. As a result of this your feed is nothing but celebrities posting psusdo self help positivity and major brands trying their hardest to make painfully unfunny posts to get clicks. At the present there aren't true ads but when your feed consists primarily of brands and corporations making constant posts with no way to get away from them it's kind of the same thing but worse.So many garbage accounts on here. I spend most of my day blocking & muting accounts that it is getting tiring.I think I'm the First Indian to Review it, it was cool at First but backspacing doesn't work (in mid sentence) properly if you are posting something, it stopped working I don't know why, can't say much about it, it automatically navigated through my insta profile and thread profile, I think the Server was not ready for such response from user, it has potential.This is amazing 😍 App I wish you all public is participating this app it's App life Change ❣️ it's very crazy 🤣 app and friendship 💕Easy and smooth like creamThis app was amazing but there's no messaging Option in thereapp has bug on scroll, looks like its glitch or something on androidContinue glitching screen overlaps previous feedGreat twitter alternative, just have no idea why I'm seeing the whole world's posts and not just those posts from people I follow?? I don't want to see posts from those I don't follow, how do I change to see just those posts from people I follow?be careful ! The account of this program is the same as your Instagram account, and if you delete this program for any reason and delete your account, your Instagram account will also be deleted!No way to turn off auto playNot worth downloading, I still think Twitter is better. This is too dull.it needs a bit more features.It's so optimized and user friendlyGreat Instagram texts based conversation app Really amazing 😍The app is glitching! Please fix this.Initially seems to be great. But, its to early to comment on performance ( No of users & usage etc). Initial rating if 👍👍👍👍👍Great alternative to the musky blue bird.I don't still understand the application Can't I send messages on the applicationSo far so good, but still short on features. Off the top of my head, please add landscape mode for my docked tablet, hashtags, DMs, post editing... then we're good XD Looking forward to eventual fediverse server integrationoften crash or force close their ownCannot scroll, app is a glitchAmazing! Really nice to see that Twitter now has a big competitor and they need to buckle up. Elon thought Mark was coming physically to fight him, but Mark fought him from the product angle. Really nice branding/marketing strategy! I have downloaded and retained my Instagram username on Thread. Let's see where we go from here. I believe more updates will be rolled out soon.When I downloaded it it just started to hang, making the pictures blur and breaking the pixels. It was soo bad experience for suree... I am just reinstalling it hoping that the issue is solvedApp is crashed sometimes forced closeThreads app good but changing some tolls new future addd best of luck threads teamI like it better than twitter, please, please, be the twitter killer.You can't download pictures and you just see only random post not your followThere is screen flickering issue in this appVery nice and function of zukarbarg familiesEarly adopter and having fun on Threads. This is like when I just first used Facebook😂*** DO NOT INSTALL *** The amount of personal information that it collect is beyond words. You'll be tracked in more ways that you can possibly imagine. Go to a mastodon server you tust. Go see your family and friends in person but please don't became a victim of yet another Meta/Facebook tracker.crashes when trying to attache images in a quoteHello sir. Outstanding amount app thanks and please slove my account all problems.The app can be more interactive.Needs optimisation but it's better than Twitter for sureImmediately after getting this Instagram deleted two of my three pinned posts and refuses to let me upload anything. It's acting like I haven't posted anything yet everyone else can see them. It's really weird and needs fixing or both apps are just uselessCannot open the app......check the glitchIt scams you, you cannot delete account, it steals away all of your data.Had so much hope for it, but it's unusable. Crashed every time I tried to post and filled my feed with junk. Any feed from the people I followed became invisible instantly, swamped by random garbage I don't want to see. Uninstalled.Nice and cool Can you add dark mode to itIts only 1 day ago 5m downloading to 10m downloading Its too much fast running app downloadingThis is a pointless add on. Seriously just give it up that Twitter beat you at the thread game. People who use Instagram really do not care about threads af of they do they already use Twitter. The interface is also bland the vid posts look clunky with the text posts and the interface just makes the expernce a treasure hunt that you did not want to go on. Scroll across nope! Just down and down and oops missed a post up up up. Hey where did the feelng in my thumb go?It's always better at first tries but later then gets boring. The interfsce is still not that smooth and the feed is messy. I always see random people on my feed even though I don't follow them.This app only made up Rich peoples, poor peoples phones not support this app. Full bug. Shame.Great app. Would have give 4 stars but gave 5 to get ratings up. LolMaking IG account the only option to get on this app isn't a good move.. 👎🏾👎🏾Lot of bugs evening post is overlappingLaunched wayy to early. Missing essential features, content is just Instagram without pictures. If it improves I might rate it higher but for now it's just too bare bones.Very simple and superb app😇Love the app but the thing I don't understand is why my ig account will get deleted if I delete the threads app🙄🤔😔.I got problem with my account, I couldn't see my profile, post a thread, see my following or my notifications. Where can I find a solution for thisNot working on OnePlus 3T Android 8.1I like the reloading animationThis app is Very attractive for me it is good for platform in social mediaBug when scrollingBuggy when i try to follow people, but otherwise wonderful.Can't unfollow accounts and app closes out when I try to look at the comments Edit: still can't unfollow accountsI like the uncomplicated usage and ease of reposting the content with my peoplePhotographer and journalism wants to inform peoples what is happining around the worldThreads still needs improvement to competition with Twitter. Hashtag and DM should also be supported.Greatest app of all time feel like it gonna take over Twitter cheers to Mark Zuckerberg and his team for creating such a wonderful app🎉🎊This has potential but the app functions like it was designed by people who have never used social media. I lost count of how many features are missing. It's so limited for an app designed by a billion dollar tech company. It seems as though it was prematurely released to appease shareholders. It's very messy. I also don't like all the censoring taking place. Unless it's blatant hate speech no one should be censored. Let people discuss differing opinions and fix your app.I'm not able to add my professional account. Can we add multiple accounts like Instagram? If yes how?So far so good ! But sometimes it doesn't upload!Give the app 5 star best app ever love it very entertaining and realExcited to try this new app from Insta. Seems like Twitter initially. Will add more thoughts after using. I can't see any reviews yet so this could be the first reviews ever. 😛Not really sure the point of this. 90% of what I see isn't anything follow anywhere else.I just love this app, it's amazing and it's like a cooler Twitter app so farGrow with technology Do Positive Chnages .I can't see what i'm typing because its being blocked by my keyboard interfaceDisplay glitch. Please Fix Fastboring and no one is even on it after one weekWhat rubbish. What to do with 2 insta apps. DisappointedAmazing and mind-blowing application.Looks like combination of Twitter & InstagramKinda nice to me even it is new social media but they're part of meta i mean it's all goodIt's like Twitter but it have many more options for privacySimply put, it's Twitter, but fun!In starting I'm so excited to use this but now its a waste of time app....Sometimes I can't comment, it keeps telling me post failed to uploadSimple i think it is twitter vassion of instagram the same featureNeeds words, not a real twitter competitor just yetSo far so good. Look forward to web version.Should add a dm feature,a trending tab and rename repost feature as rethreadWhen I get started making an account here, it was crashing and lagging but my phone was perfectly fine no any issues or any other problems. I guess this app needs more enhancement and fix to the issues.Nice app. I think it can be an alternative of Twitter.Every time when I open the app it's like full of glitches 😕Good app but still waiting for a home pageNot fit to use - full of glitches...Nice Interface With InformationProblem with photos and video download saveThreads an Instagram app, expecting high.🔥Zuck thinks he just gonna make me increase the screen time by using this app ? Huh, I think he is right 🥲Bug: Crashing when adding photo comments.

Looks so simpleAbsolutely loving it so far! Just wish we could Pin posts in our threads?? Is that coming down the pipe later? Thanks!It doesn't have many people now, but I'm sure it will be great when people start to be active on itGreat app so far, guess you guys should add dm, bookmark and polls quick thoWhen i want to login form my account it shows two factor authentication after j recieve the otp its of 6 digit the app says to give 8 digit codeThe app is amazing and very very smoothPerfect. Always good to be #1 or #2. No other ipo matters--See nothing special about it. Another space to consume my data 😥😥🥺🥺 If u no get data , no just download this app😋🤭🏃🏃 If u no get better update for this space, no join us. Leave am for us to run am 1 star should discourage uIt's like copy of Twitter... Which also didn't in better way.Twitter always special Instagram always special We hope better 🎈The screen keeps scrolling it ownPlzzz halp not working this aap my phone this app is very big bug plzzz update on this app plzzzzThe interface is superbSeems good, but i need a dark modeThis is a most useful and same Twitter work but it is a Instagram by the meta tagsMan I can't change my username, even there's no any option to log in without Instagram account. It's not fare dude 🫣THE BEESSTTTT love this app! hoping for real great updates soonPlease stop showing accounts that I don't follow. Why follow button exist if you only spammed threads from other accounts that I don't follow.This app is not interesting nothing new same as Twitter , waste of timeMeta garbage. Don't waste your time with this Fukkerberg trash. Massive waste of time.Very bad interfaceThis is just an all-encompassing Twitter imitation, with nothing new or innovative in itA good challenger to tweeter and easy to useApp isn't working properlyI mean we just got here so I'm not expecting the world, however, seeing that we're going from Instagram straight to Threads, I'm disappointed to see that I can't seamlessly switch between my accounts on Threads like I can on Instagram.Great sha but I can't turn mine to dark modeSomthing I'm Unable to open app It's Coved with TextVery glitchh and bugs in my device.Does not allow nsfw art so it's not going to replace twitter, unfortunately.Please I've activated an account but can't find dark mode. Need help activating dark modeMany problems in this app and facing many bugsLooks Great! Easy to use.Freezing after opening appRequires Instagram account. I don't have one. Bye!After installing it. My app is getting stuckSo I am the first one to give review On 6 jul....tell me about it's progress...good and bad updates on the times when you read my comment...have a good dayAddictive af.....work on more featuresI would like to see \"only following\" option, so I won't see strangers on my Thread, like asap, please and thanks!Most awesome app.love the user interfaceKind of laggy app and does not give the real twitter experience 🤷This is nice app to creativity with text..Clutter free fast experienceLike a Twitter copycat but without the toxicity (At the moment, we'll see)Not properly scroll ..... Display seens like glitch..Good user interface.When I try to login with my Instagram, it is asking 8 digit authentication code but it is providing me 6 digit code. How can I login...Very clever marketing they give threads app options in Instagram that take you to playstore and open thread download. I just want to know that threads (meta) can takeover a job of Twitter?Glitches and unusable. I can't do anything with it.Not working and it's all a messAll in one best featuresNot as good as Twitter it needs more polish but great start imoVery interesting , Clear and useful Apps 👏🏽Make it so we can log in without Instagram. I don't have nor do I want an Instagram accountHas potential. But switching accounts is clunkyIt's amazing and surprisingly better than TwitterAhh yes, another app with too many permissions to take user information://Why do you need Instagram to sign on? Too many adsCan't even message people on the app, rather twitteri miss the \"trending topics\", a chat and i don't wanna see the activities from others that the people i follow are followingI have not used it yet, it is very difficult to say about it..!😊Kinda useless without a chronological feed with only the people I followTaking Too Much time to upload photo.. 🤮No chat/dm button, please add this feature.Excellent first start, look forward to moreAmazing app i feel the positive energyI am unable to post photos here. Kindly fix thisLittle brother of Instagram 😂 But quite good.Ok so far. But why am I seeing threads from people that I'm not following/ nor have any interest in? This app won't last long if that doesn't changeGreat UI and UX .First time using it there still a lot of bugsIt's great to follow the things that you already follow on Instagram today like your friendsBasically, Twitter without the problems.Homepage of the application is not loading on my phone.I just have to be the first to make a review here. The app is amazing so far Represent Tanzania 🇹🇿So many threads or posts from people i don't follow keep showing at Home, it's so annoying :( i want to only see threads from people i followedAwesome interface, SMOOTH& SIMPLEAwesome and smooth learning appLove it. But does it come in black (dark mode)? 😂Absolutely amazing...no need of Tweeter anymore...😂🤭Create your own Lists is Not a Feature. Only Following permitted makes this like Other New Social Platforms. It's Limiting & Not Convenient like Twitter for Grouping Numerous Topics & User Sources to review Easily. Meta obviously linked Threads Platform with Instagram quickly with little Value of Users regarding Lists. Is Follow Only better for Digital Data Capitalism? Hopefully it will Evolve. Does Threads have Follow Limit like Twtr for Users with Few Followers which having Lists increases?Very promising, waiting for the updatesThis app is glitching can't do anything don't install iti can't share threads to my story on Instagram or my feed, it loads but doesn't do anythingGreat app. Add trending topics section.At this time it doesn't allow new accounts, only Instagram signupLooks similar to Twitter but has some great experience than Twitter in some views??? If you are a Facebook user but not IG, how can one set up an account to try this out?Seems to be working OK so far but only had it a dayFollowing topics instead on only people is mych better. Trending topics requiredwhen installing the app it crashedIt'a a mess, can't even read anything, at all.Good App, But Not Have Feature of Delete AccountJust installed. Looks cool. Will update my review once something exciting happen.Very nice app. UX is better than twitter.Dont like the insta account merging and no desktop siteCrashes on startup!Provide signup with google ,facebook ,twitter and other appsGood so far, but can't see all my followers for some reason.Yeah app is good but it showing some glitches in my phone .Really great interfaceAn rate from the very beginning of the application ♥️♥️Twitter is best ever In this app same strict restrictions as Instagram and Facebook uselessI haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it'll be better user experience than elon musk appeverything is fine but i felt collecting users data😴😴😴Mediocre at best. Disappointing launch.Poor UI and FunctionalityHey instagram I don't able to use this app on my Redmi 6 there is a killer glitch please solve thisOsm quality but hashtag options not showing..It's bugging. I don't know if it's because of my phone but it's laggingI don't know much about this app but still trying to understand the app. You can follow on me threads and Instagram:/shahjada_ajayLooks really cool . easy to useLightweight & fast copy of Twitter 😜 well done meta 🐥♥️Scrollview not working in 'Activity' layout page.Much better than twitter and its only been 12 hoursFix bug. App crashedI think it's good to compete with Twitter. They are creating monopoly.Love the UI, hope there won't be any tantrums or privacy drama out here...Nice Apps, increase more features 😇Seems it could be popular, nice sleek designIf it pisses off Elmo, who is imploding 🐦 faster than a visit to the Titanic, then it MUST be off to a GREAT start.I have only spent 10 minutes on this app, and I'm already obsessed with it...First guy to review. This app will either be a great success or a downfall, let's see then....More typical lefturdwoketurdvaxxtarded censorship twatter wannabe app (that offers nothing new and far less capabilities) with FULL data mining and harvesting capabilities. This is an echochamber already. But hey, if you are a perfectly programed person, indoctrinated, and/or brainwashed, and don't want to hear anything against your liberal and woke ideologies, then this app may be for you!The app is glitching, and I cannot see anything.Super Just 7 hours 1 million download this is excellentmy screen is glitch like crazy yo. Sony Xperia XZ1 Android 9 hereNice app with excellent UI 💖It's awesome, Twitter is so ancient!Fabulous app in building..hope it will be less toxic in comparison with Twitter..Twitter knockoff. Censorship platform. Connected to Instagram which is not idealGreat app, needs an OLED dark modeI am the 31019 to join this app. I expect it is better to use than twitter.Don't tell anyone..this is copy paste business not your creative app..so you can release a new creative app for usBuggy app, unusable.Just a bad fediverse instance with bad moderation and stupid reposted memes, also a lot of bots that hype the app for nothingNice Platforms, like the bird 👀This is beautiful,expressive and soothing🔥This is Instagram with a new logo and in black. That's all it is. Stoopid.I don't have an instgram account, and i don't know where i can sign up for a new account.So far not a big fan. Its alright but my feed is majority people I am not following nor are of any interest to me. Until I only see people I follow on my feed I wont give it any more stars. I dont care about things that dont align with my interests.Could be a good thing if they leave ads out. Its giving pre Elon Twitter and baby steps towards MySpace (btw I miss you MySpace)the lowkey version of twitter, but I liked it though...Cool App Better Than Twitter Its Easier TO \"USE\" BUT It Has Some Problems Like You Cant Use HashtagsI like it is simple no much color no thingsVideos are not taking full widthI'll be the first to write a review. Not bad, a little rough around the edges, but we'll see how it develops with time. Note: Don't try and delete your profile. You will also trash your IG account.App is crashing again and againThe app is not working properlyWell I hoped that it was like Twitter where you can post NSFW artworks but unfortunately it isn't like Twitter so I don't think it can replace Twitter anytime now. I hope that instead of restrictions for NSFW we'd have a spoiler tag for R-18 pictures, so it can be censored but still allowed to be posted.Very simple app.The app is soooo glitchy, I don't know if I'm the only one who experience this.Oh,this is really nice and better than the bird app🥴No, I do not want to login with my Instagram ID or Facebook account or WhatsApp number.Very bad graphicsQuite satisfying for me, far away than that chaos of Twitter 🥲It's buggy on my phone. Im on Android 9Too many glitches I can't even open the appapp get continuosly crashesGreat start.. Needs lot of updatesThis is junk. Why create yet another Meta App that does the same thing as all your other ones.Glitches extremally bad even when I uninstalled & reinstalled itGreat to have an Alternative to the sinking ship known as TwitterUseless app. Dumb censure, like at all meta social. No free speech, no free words. It's no Twitter style. Not for 1%. JUST WASTE YOUR TIME. WANNA TEXT? GO TWITTER. W/O USELESS CENSURE IN 2023.Glitch problem not showing anythingHey I don't why but it is glitching alot idk what happened I need helpNo search function makes the app next to useleasGreetings everyone I am Saiful from Bangladesh I have installed this apps today but it is not opening can I know the reasonBetter than Twitter But we need the category selection featureWhen I use this app, it's very smooth then twitter.No browser version and I don't use Instagram so I can't use itLike usual, they won't let you pick unique username even though you are early. f ZuckerbergGiving a strong competition to Twitter. Loving this app.❤️❤️App is good. But there is no dark mode.

Poor way to launch an app dudesThe UX is exceptional , way bettwr than twitterWow such a master blaster and easy to use 💫👍Awful app.just doesn't workAmazing feeling better now taking it forward to enjoy itit have more bugs which have to be fixIts buggy in huawei and crash when scrollingMark mark you better make easy this time around.This App Is so smart And good work But Something wrong How can i get my video viewersAwesome app, and very easy to useNice app, optimisation needed.Very nice app, enough to compete with tweetersGraphics lag too muchIt's glitched everytime I open the apps.I only get 1 notification at a time.

If you want to delete your threads account you need to delete your Instagram account! This app is totally rubbish!🏆 I am the first person to give review to this app.. This is gonna be one of the finest talk of the town app soon.. Best of Luck Threads, and Mark Zuckerberg... 👍🔥Too many stupid restrictions, I can't post pics as I want to, I can't even post threads as I want to, its either goes against community standards or it fails to upload my threadsGood app and when I use this 90 day then I know reality of this app so my give review the any problemSimilar to tweeter but it's better more than that 💖💪🏽After a sec of looking around I finally understand the app. You write and thread and people comment and interact with them. You link your Instagram to the app and you have your account. Try it out!Cool app looks like Twitter but better and easy to useI don't like it at all. To take someone idea, without using your mind. This is disgusting. Mark Zuckerberg should be shameful about that. His only idea is Facebook, after that he only pay money for buying someone minds.App constantly crashesDoes it allow one to have multiple accounts just like Instagram? Or is it for one account only?Need Gif Support and More interactive UISo far so good and it's really organizedPlease add account switch like on instagram (hold profile picture bottom right to change accounts)force close every try to upload photoI didnt get insta notes and I don't have feature same in my other acc don't download itIt's like an alternative of an app starting with letter t.Just logged, Symbol missing in Keyboard🥲We want an update because the app has become very boringThis is better app,Update the feed of this app,overall amazing.An app made by Suckerberg scraping Twitter's data.

I'll give it 8 months before it failsAmazing Application. Thanks team MetaWe can't raise our voice here like twitter plz make a new way for trending topics and for people voiceActually pretty stable app.This needs the translation option thingy asapThis is more interesting. Let's keep it interestingWhy won't the developers allows us to send gif images like they do for iPhone users?More simple and easier experience than Twitter, it needs some features and will domenate this field, like private messaging, website for PC interface, trending hashtags and clear plan for marketers and analysts for digital marketing field.With this new platform, they're taking the concept of storytelling to a whole new level. Will it give Twitter a run for its money?Nice app but it needs to be user friendlyIncredible! So much simple to useI thank the chairman of meta team because it's good to open this app , now I'll delete Twitter ☺️No discoverability and no trends tabGreat and easy to useMuch needed app 😄 Hope in coming days it reaches more people.

But I'm sure that Twitter is crying....It's look like twitter 🤣🤣 Mr mark..... ‼️it's a copy paste app.... 🤣🤣 & Mr. Mark has developed another way to steal our data... 🔥 Congratulation Mr mark 👌This is not a good application like Twitter this is a cheap copy of TwitterI wish translation option be available soonMarathi language is not availableApp failed to update the postsI will give a review after use some days.But as a new app I feel pretty good about using it.This app never supports the general public as it is an invaluable tool with othersBugged, shadowing text & imageHow is this app already number one on play store already, that's impossible!Hope have dark mode function.Missing some features but I can definitely feel the return of humanity on my feed. Really eager to use hashtags and search public posts but so far Threads is a breath of clean fresh air compared to the stench rising from the heap of hateful garbage Twitter was allowed to becomeCreate threads lite this so heavy space and nice appI am not Instagram user. Without Instagram a/c. can I use Threads?? please reply/guide.only is the problem is data shareLove it. It's like a twitter but I think it's betterVery good app copy of InstagramVery good app for writing our memes and quotes ✌️💙App is so good But want to add the unhide threads id optionFew features and just a sad excuse for a platform. It's like if Twitter was somehow worse and made by the worst marketing guy you know.AWFUL!! Dont waste your time. This is the cheap Alibaba / Wayfair / Banggood Twitter. Gross 🤢🤮Not working properly 😐Not working properlyNot working properlyIdk why the app closes itself if I search a user then click under post repliesIt's just sad how u don't have as many followers as u do on Instagram 😒😭I don't know what's it purpose, it is similar to Facebook and Twitter ... nothing newPretty cool so far. Can't wait to see where it goes.Amazing app but meta needs more updates on this app for better useApp is not functioning properlyIt keeps crashing..Great app and very simplisticAwesome app to use best competitor for Twitter 😂Excellent, easy to use.Seems like a good and useful app from my experience so farIt bug every pageThere is no Direct Message system but better than Twitter👍🏻Good one , it will be gamechanger and Twitter might affected.I don't have Instagram so I can't try it out.It's great it was very easy just like TwitterGood app it seem like twitter but better than twitterOption to hide replies in profile needed.hey insta threads please add save button on photos in threads.The app is amazing the people are kind welcoming it feels like home 🖤🖤🖤🖤Best way to dominate social media few things less more to come I thinkI don't want to see all these celebrities taking up my feed when I'm not even following them. Have an option for following and a FYP like tiktok!Pretty good, need more features thoBoring app Copy of twitter .just wasting of time .It's crashing while I scroll verry poor experienceVery Nice 👍 app Easy to Use and better than Twitterthe app always force close when want to read some commentsLove it, new clear community So much fun and im expecting moreYou guys need to save our login, so we can change with multiple accounts.its really nice and good.., and the same time Hashtag is not working. i have a question is Hashtag option is there or not, is there available mean its not working right now. please consider the it, make sure you guys will fix this bug.. Hashtag is most important one, i hope you guys will get understand the concerns.. waiting for your replyCopy and paste of Twitter... what a shame app is this one.Definitely like it much better than Twitter.A very bad application first, because I hate a person called Mark, secondly, because he is a literal imitation of TwitterIt's crashing on my phone (motorola z2 force)He's very nice app and is a little bit better than TwitterIt keeps logging me out of Instagram when I use threads, why??Decided to have a look, but you need an Instagram account. I don't have one.I don't like that my time line is flooded with people I don't follow. Too messy for me.No porn no disturbing content it's just you and your family sharing stuff it's perfectVery good app to connecting peopleNo Ads👍,Need Hash Tag trendings,Pin Post and More FuturesI rather not make an Instagram account to not use just so I can check out this appIt doesn't allow me to post free speech, Its sided with US democratic party. It's import to note Im not even from US and they force their woke content on me. Freedom of speech doesn't exist. Download Twitter ✌🏻 its real deal.Instagram + Twitter= Thread But I want switch acc like on Instagram option on threadsVery good app can be better replacement for Twitter 💗You can also add pin threads on profile, feature 👍🏻Needs content search and #️⃣ supportCombination of Twitter and Instagram.... Good...I think it's the first time I am supporting mark Zuckerberg but tbh threads is a really good app and it deserves a 5 star ratingWow. Amazing App. It’s may be attract Twitter 🫶Don't have and don't want an Instagram account... So I can't use the appOkay app for now. It can be better of course, but time will show.They want me to pay for a service that show's no improvementdoesn't want to login in my INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT it keeps saying \"error\"Heavy Goverment Censorship - An empty Short Bus of fail. My advise, short meta this turd is going to tank harder than the metaverse ...Absolutely amazing apps thread very useful batter then Twitter ☺️Design are not completeBest for engagement and fast followingGreat first day experience for me! Very promising.Really like this app because they don't have any restrictionsWay too much data is collected, a dak zebi d zuck jm3 kerkWow just wow!!... Anything I can't do on Twitter I can do on Threads!!...I can view unlimited post's and there are No ADS!!...Meta THANK YOU!!Need Account Switching option like Instagram feature😁😁you should be able to share someones insta acct from the instagram app to threads. just a suggestionHorrible app, mark need to jump off a bridgeGreat app and I can't stop using it!Bad this app only for highest follower person note for any low capacity person I'm disappointed😞😞Needs trending feature like the bird 🐦Bad IT work done!It needs a lot of featuresBlah another waste of time zuck. Your lack of freedom of speech is irritating.App always force close randomlyIt's good but please add GIF !!Pretty much a copy of Twitter except you'll get censored if you speak out about certain topics so no free speech!An obvious cash grab by Zuckerberg to mimic twitter. Only gripe is the inability to delete your threads account once you create it. You have to delete your entire instagram account once you create it if you wanna get rid of it. New users bewareThere must be an option to delete the account without deleting the instagram account. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻This app is only a cheat of Twitter. I have downloaded this because that I have to follow Imran Khan on this and no more special thing in this appGood, plain, easy. No WIDGETS???This is very good 👍 and hundred percent workingWorthless Not worth downloading. The app won't open.Since most of the people have multiple accounts on instagram, I hope it will be possible to have multiple accounts in threads too.It's a copy from twitter and I can't remove my account after signing upMy experience has been of half naked tasteless woman and perverted men and I will be discouraging anyone to use it... Matter of fact I have posted my horrible experience on social media... I will try to make it go viralVery good app. More tools waitingVry bad experience , app does not work properlyVery userfriendly application.A trap for instagram users if you download this you then can't delete this account or your insta account will be also deleted.This app is better then twitter because we post on Instagram it will also post on threads and FacebookBoring app. No features and nothingReally so nice app.. I like itt. And thanku for you make this applicationGood for v1 need improvement like hashtags and trendThis application is very good, this application could be the best social media applicationMy feed is just full of people I didn't follow????? Can't even find the posts of people I did follow.For the next update, I want there to be a translation for those who don't know the languageIt's awesome.... Twitter should rest and allow thread to breathewarning this app WILL suspend your instagram account if you decide to follow all the accounts you follow already on Instagram. There is ZERO appeal process.I'm getting lot of glitch while scrolling... I don't know how to report that thingIm not able to post the photo on the appNow esay to find new friends on this app. Thankyou InstagramPut translation button please.Need Instagram account. I don't have one, and I don't want to make one.Good but it's not easy to change accountRubbish app...its like insta lite version.Better than Twitter. Have all the paid functionalities of Twitter here for free.This app is good to use, however I can't post photos.Hundred millions times better than other competitor app.twitter but slightly more modern, and less toxicNeeds a translate featureIt is so wonderful and it will be greater than Twitterplease fix interface. its broken on my phoneNot working properlyThis app looks like very nice but Twitter bad only Threads love 💕😘Ok so using it to know better and to appreciate the creativity.Great alternative to the chaos and hate of Twitter.Hang...

It's kind of like Twitter but it's a bit different.Whenever I try to post the application crashesThe good app so gorgeous 😍Thanks to the creator of Insta for making this appIt's so nice. The flows are seamlessThis cheap knock-off suck! I'm going back to Twitter.Threads app is amazing but Twitter is always be Twitter no one beat him #muskThe number one reason this app is getting 1 star is because the company behind this app will censor anything they do not agree with. Maybe they should promote this app in china.application is dancing and showing mosquito #screen shakingI don't have an Instagram account so I couldn't create an account.It's way better than twitter cause it's easy to go when you're in IGHating it. No save option hashtags many moreno android split screen . . . maloThis totally bull**it. What a garbage by Zinger Burger company Meta. They are stealing data and useless today's people are using it and give them all data.Please add (Dari ) language zuck Because it's official language of Afghanistan 🇦🇫🇦🇫🙂it's a really good app but has so many glitches...Same to Same Instagram. I don't like this application.I used app approx 5.7 days nice and smooth appgreat but i wait for upcoming featuresPlease provide editing tools while uploading pics videosVery usefull social media app same to instagrameI love this app keep going ! Much better than twitter !!I can't change the theme of the app on my Android phoneI don't really care. I just like seeing billionaires fight and watching people take sides.It's not working with Xiaomi devices.Hard left biased censorship. Why can't we just have free speech and open dialog? What are you so afraid of?It's superbbbb good but atleast give a close friend option and where we should post some stories?? @zuck reply pleaseUnable to post imagevery smooth workingIt is nice and has hight qualityI liked it compared to Twitter..i got 2 followers in just a minute..but Twitter gives me almost 8 years straight to have 8 followers 🤔Too much data Collection.This is good, i ve downloaded it but is unfair that you never added Nigeria for eligible country for Facebook mornitization, upon Nigerians are where you have much lovers and follows,Lovely app, great twitter competitor.Not bad. Please provide polls and gif options for us.Can't even see a thing. Its just glitching .currently unable to upload pics in threadsGreat but not to the level of twitter 🙂Not working properly server down 👇👎I regret I installed it. Horrible app discriminating Ukrainians. Linking Threads deletion with Instagram deletion is threatening and intimidating to users. Make an option to delete it!!!If doesn't have Instagram account we can not use this app....... This is one type of marketing ....Always fc when uploading a photoApp keep getting crashedIt's a copy of Twitter there should some new featuresThe care and love for the ux is impressiveThe app is not responding in my phone I'm using infinix s5Needs tweeking but it's a good start. The best thing is that it's rubbing it's nutsack across Elon Musk's racist gob and the RWNJs and Nazis aren't anywhere to be seen!Very bad app for the the personal data privacyUnoriginal and cheap rip off.Name cannot be changed if you are coming from Instagram. Alot of trackersBrilliant twitter alternative but NEEDS multiple account stitching.make it better and keep subscription free plzterrible app. Can't create a new account.The rich vs. the rich. Wait until they talk of data security. It's a game of Thrones!Amazing and smooth AppI like it so far, but I think it needs to be polishedMassive privacy leech. Do not download. Just delete twitter and move on.In this application very bugs and glitches 😞😞😞😞A cheap copycat of twitter that loses a lot of twitter and instagram features and the community is horrible i prefer twitter fights over themI don't know how this app works and whether it can earn money or not I don't know anything but I'm giving it a review it's very good it can earn money or not I don't know if money can be earned It is good if money can be earnedUseless and fully copied of Twitter.😑Social media is fun again! Much better than the toxicity at Twitter!Not able to login in this applicationEveryone talking about it like this is better than Twitter but where's trending button? 😭I tweeted in Threads, No More Monopoly. Thanks you META!Its aight, I want a dim light background thoughIt's an amazing app to advance as a upcoming influencerTwitter is better than threads 😕 It is the same copy paste of twitter 🙃 Not bad Mark!This app went from 4.9 stars to 3.2 stars. CrazyAn unknown network error occured.It's clean and simple.It's a bad copy of a bad app by a desperate company. Zero stars!Giving 5 star just to piss off twitter. But eventually threads will be no different. Selling data and allowing fake news and hate speech to circulate.Great app. Much much better than twitter.Idk but this app is buffering when i opened it check my threads on ash233u accountThis app just for apple is work? My cellphone was android ,when i connet with my id write error and cant join,Server too slow pls improveYall wrong nothing is wrong with this app , it's only that yall using an app which has the illuminati symbol, look at those 6s 😂😂😂😂I'm out of hereApp good but not working properly.No dm video playing without audioWas looking for a new Social media app and found it.

Easy to block Nazis and bigots, unlike Twitter. Room for improvement on usabilityI can't even log in.

And please dont put direct message of this app i hope my concern reaches the developerCan't use it without an Instagram account.There is a screen glitch in my threads account. Try to solve the glitch (Device:- Redmi note 6 )Better than Twitter, far more convenient.This app is better than twitter and Instagram it's like mix of insta and twitter so this app is the best app in social midea 👍🤗.The simple fact that it sabotages that egomaniac elon is a plus. 5 stars from meThe app keeps crashingNeeds better switching account featureLog in with Instagram only 🙃 i dont use instagram so i uninstalled this appThis is a very great app,i think this is the best app i have seen so farWorst experience ever whenever I login this aap crashesNothing original, just a copy of Twitter.

I don't like it at allThere already recommending all the Celebrities, Politics, and Sports I've already blocked on IG, I literally don't indulge in any of this nonsense. Nice try re-Twitter Uninstalled and flagged (top right) for impersonating an already garbage app full of propaganda Karen's and far left extreme weirdosNeed to improve the performanceReally cool app, free to use unlike twitterWhat if I don't have insta account but want to use it as Twitter platform...no option for new users without instaWhy is the app crashing???????????Wonderful app, will dethrone all others.Dark theme should be added as soon as possible !!!Well hoping that more improvements, For now, i still use twitter.There should be option to connect with Facebook account tooI having trouble about logging in using my Instagram account.It's really good... Awesome @Insta team..❤️❤️NGL I haven't opened the app I just wanted to be the first to review the app 🧍🏼‍♀️I wanted to use this social network, but unfortunately its algorithms are built to destroy freedom of speech and support the Russian invasion of Ukraine, accordingly one star.This is a good competitive app for twitterDoesn't allow you to view threads only from the accounts you follow. You are forced to see all threads regardless of if you're following those accounts. Pointless posting to complete strangers.It's like windows 98, there are snake trailsSuper apps 👍 all the best all members,This threads aap like a Twitter..... But Twitter is pyed but threads is right now free.....it is help too connect all over the world in a one threads...Downloded first day of lunch. This app is fantastic. Threads is twitter killer😂😂😂This is way better and easier to use than twitterHow is this a twitter killer? Do we need this, really???

Need to be able to login solely thru Threads@We need more features like DM,modifie a post,boostThreads app is so good easy to useGood app but it needs more featuresSo far so good, long time im waiting for apps like this.Any way I can just see the people I follow rather than all the other stuff I have no interest in would be niceGreat app until the reels arriveGood but update features stillOverall attractive GUI 🫠It's glitching every timeIts a good apps. I love it. Thanks Mark ZuckerbergWho in their right mind wants to sign up for ANOTHER social media app, after everything we've learned about social media over the last decade?? Especially one created by Zuck and the meta brand? Wake up, people.I love it here but I noticed I can't tag my girls and use hashtags 😞Usefull app and features My Instagram id 1million complete thankyou so much everyone 🤗🫂looking forward to the app's improvements :))Very bad terms and conditionsGood application nice work by Instagram 😄👍I don't want to use my Instagram username. And it won't let me create a new account.Performance is so bad !! ... The Ui is GlitchingI also installed this app to see how it performs but it is performing very wellSo far so good, but i wish it could prioritize the threads of people we follow first, no all i see is threads from people i have no interest in. Please don't ruin it by making just another instagram🙃It's boring but cause everyone is on it I am on it.First of all, this isn't a standalone service, it requires an Instagram account. Second, never forget that Facebook sold 86 million users data to Cambridge Analytica to manipulate the elections, and they're being sued in Europe for anti privacy practices. They are going to steal all your information and sell it and use it for nefarious purposes. By using this app you are as guilty as they are.Crashing while opening repliesWhy I see content second time in thread which I already seen in Instagram time wastingToo slow scrollingPlz enable msg feature for better experience.Please don't put the letter's counting this is not good I wanna talk too much and express my feelings freely please solve this and let us be free in what we want to say ..I hope this app Twitter Copy. And instagram and Twitter mixing ... I hope batterThese the best platform ever for everyone 🙏🙏It is not supporting properly in my phoneI think this app very great,keep update for new fitureI'm very happy but you know what?

Working to spread russian propaganda and if you post something from real world got banned not only from here but also on joined meta accounts.it's glitching, so annoyedVery poor UI & UXI would give 5 if thread could offer the real-time hot search & hashtags..may be it would like a blue bird 555 don't worry you have the other options..I swear~I love this app tho, but how can someone text his friend on the app?I can't delete without deleting Instagram, this is a tie-inPlease Change Logo in While Opening the Thread App, it is Similar to Instagram pink colur Style.Best apps for sharing your daily threads ......with everyone's....👍🏻Great, now i can't delete my threads account without deleting my Instagram , RIP other ppl like me 💀💀 (I just needed that threads badge on profile, but now I'm stuck with this stupid app)add a seperate option to only delete threads accYesterday I downloaded and tested it. 😁 Actually its good till now.😍Nice app but i am having problem i can follow another account why is it like thatLots of bug... User screen is blurGrowth and development socially connected in a good way!no privacy. meta want to know about you everything. be carefulWhen the ability to only see the people you follow in the threads I'll give it 5 stars. The people I follow are lost in the clutter of social media influencer wannabes. Most of the negative ratings are coming from Musk fan boys. 🤷‍♂️Pretty terrible. An empty space for cold brands to just be cringy. There's no heart or community. This is plainly a rip off of Twitter and should be banned for plagiarism in all honesty.I think they want Gen Z to use it, cuz the login is through Instagram, but according to the trend Gen Z won't use it. If they stream the colosium fight in here obviously Elon musk and mark Zuckerberg's fight that might bring some traffic in there.Great. A THOUSAND times less toxic than twitter.I don't trust any app from Facebook or Instagram. They need to be sued for being racist and sexist m they have harmed my mental health for too long and need to be shut down immediately.Way better than twitter. Thanks Mark!The dark mode needs to be as dark as indtagramWonderful... Just need some new featuresNot bad.. still work in progressSuper 👌 nice 👍 It looks like similarly Twitter .I'm facing glitch issue in the app please resolve it asap.Pls add a translation buttonFeed algorithm kinda sucks right now. Gettings threads from all the people i dont know and getting really few from who i m following. Hope it will be fixedmissing so many featuresIt got crashed and was acting weirdThis app is a privacy nightmare, collects all of your data and worst of all it's owned by FacebookIt's good. But no photo download optionThere is limitation for writing threads i hope you guys will make it.anyways good app for everyone.The best app in the game by a light yearAs soon as i logged in into the app the glitchy mess tskIt's fun to be, but too much restrictions.When are you adding the search feature for things that aren't accounts?Meta are upset with the way Twitter is returning free speech, so they have decided to create a similar app that's sensor information the way they want. GarbageAll good but not user friendly . And this app takes much mbIt's a worst app and waste of time,net ,Outstanding experience! GreatOne more Way for famous, influential, corporations, and fortune 500's to get they're content out very little for the regular Guy as we're just basically posting into nothing Ness I mean what are we going to post to who TF ever we follow ie nef or National geographic or something probably not so my take is unless your already famous or Rich good luck getting any actionI'm trying to switch my account to private but it's not working... Not satisfied 😕Good app but crushes on my android everytime I want to post a picPretty cool.

Why do we need something \"like Twitter\" when we already have a Twitter?Don't make socials apps regional...

No thanks!Brilliant 👍.I really like this app. Threads > 🐦Very smooth and good appIt's a good app with good featuresWork hard on this application because it looks so horribleCan't wait for mark and Elon to duke it out. Great work boyZGreat app and much better than Twitter.the app always say \"sorry, something went wrong\" 😔Please Enable Personal chat option on Threads appDon't download this if u r interovert full time wasteworst app, it's so slow to installLegging too much cant see anythingIt's an amazing app for micro bloggers.Awesome experience. Infact better than Twitter.Seeing tweets of every tom dick and harry on my timeline. None of who are followed by me.I love the app a lot but there's no place to chatJust amazing 🤩 I really recommend this app to those who love instagram or Facebook ❤️This is just Twitter, but 10 times more terribleSo far so good, it still requires a couple of features including built-in translator, gifs, private messaging and more. looking forward to this app, it has so much potentialGood experience so far. One thing is sure that this is far better than the nonsense that happens in Facebook community.Worked initially and now it won't open.No search. Cynical user trap. Risible logo.awesome,simplest version of Twitter 👍🏻👍🏻💯💯It's a great app however I can't open my Instagram now 😭 why?100% addictive 100% good 100% better than TwitterCan only search for users not post content. With Twitter I can search for say \"protest London\" and see all tweets about protests in London. No such function on Threads. Means I only see what those I follow post and their opinions, not a vast array of opinions.Better than twitter. Carry on. Love it.thank u metaAnything apart from twitter, I am good.The first few days of the app is so good then here comes the controversy with threads vs twitter to be honest this is better at least we can view unlimited post and satisfy peopleThis app is not working properly .

Elon Musk can keep his bird app.Not working properly 😔Pretty good but nothing really that entertainingTerrible experience. Just use mastodon directly.the app is so good and easy to useOne Of The Best Platform For Text Information posting Batter Then TwitterFirst, they are accessing precise location without consent. The app is such a twitter knock off that it is hard to use you and even harder to navigate for content you want. The amount of personal data they are taking without even a single option to reject or approve is ridiculous. Will not be using this unethical app.The app crashed on first log in.When I Click this app review there is no reviews about this app so may be I am the first person who is writing a review from India without using it 😂😁😁 This is a messager app I I am using it review section as a communication 😂 Hope you guys like this ☝️☝️👍Cheap imitation and patheticThere is a issue when I tried to login with my Instagram credentials. Even though giving correct id and password I am unable to login in my android device over and over. Hope that alternate login system eg: forgot password, send OTP etc. will be added soon. This info might help: Device Name: Samsung Galaxy A10 Android Version: 11I am the first I would like to say that it is a great and easy application that is worth trying.follow me \" ibrahimosama13\"Annoying.. why am I forced to ee random people's thoughts that I could not care less about. Twitter you follow people you are interested in. Threads you are forced garbage. Oh and can't delete once you join.Best App For Thought Sharing But Logo Is Bad... Please Change Threads LogoTotally waste of timeWhen I opened the app, it's just like that I'm using Instagram.Need save option as soon as possible.My problem is videos to play itself why don't you remove itGood so far hope to see it grow with more optionsJust a copy of twitter with more privacy issuesExcellent app Nice featuresIt's good platform for as compare Twitter ✨Can you bring switching account. I have 2 account so I can switch account easily like InstagramSo far so good. Anything is better than Twitter has become.Faltu App sobai bekar keno dawnload korche ke jane... Sobai bujhtei parche na instagram extra taka kamanor jonno ai sob faltu app bar kore che sei moto sobai dawnload kore jache.....🙂🙂🙂Gooood much better than Twitter lol it's simple and goodHave you been enjoying Threads so far? 👀Did you know you can share your content from Threads to Instagram Stories, where your followers will see a clickable preview. 👋 Try it and tag us in your stories! 🧵As soon as I got logged in on the app the entire thing is an unusable glitchy mess. I can't even see my screen, it's just pixels tearing in every direction. I'm guessing it hasn't even come close to being optimized for every device yet.Please fix it, Tq 🙏Enable logout option or enable switch accountAdd a share button option to share using direct messageIt's a meh can't even change my profile pic or migrate my stuff from insta please fixNo freedom of speech. Biased platform. You will get banned when you talk against certain groups. You will get banned when you say the truth. Islamophobia will be defined as freedom of speech though. This happens on all meta platforms. Twitter is the best.Bad Apps ! Copying Mark Zuck is Noob Apps Best Apps For Twitter Elon Musk is My Favourite Pro AppsCrashes when I try to upload a pictureA good one. Just a like master copy of Twitter!👽Nice app. Would have given more than 5 stars if permitsRubbish can't sign up or get in as I'm not on InstagramExcellent application and better then TwitterGood copy of Twitter but not better than Twitter 😅The app is beautiful......Please follow Panda.officialboy🙃🙂🥲It's like twitter with lot more featuresCan't replace Twitter bcz all insta insta influencers spitting same content as on Instagram.It is ok if you put post button on right top.So you select who you want to follow, refresh the feed, and it shows a ton of accounts that aren't even close to who you follow, and the timeline isn't synced up so you'll be scrolling back and forth. What a waste of a potential Twitter replacement.Should able to edit an thread likely add an feature to edit or add more option to posting threads. (Cant add gif / hashtags on the 'threads' )why is dark theme is the last thing u add onto an app. Dead serious questionUseless!!! After installing it a couple days ago it logs me out of both Threads & intagram! Plus keeps asking me to log back in! Never happened before with insta for many years! Uninstalling both.. wish I could give it zero ⭐'s Going back to Elmo's app!This app is just straight bad. They censor everything. The logo is literally a 666.Haven't tried it yet, but the 5 stars were given cause I hate Twitter :))Very best application for users.Good but need hastag and also hope can make live video on our accountThe app is great and I like I can connect to my favourite celebrity's. However since I downloading and installing threads my instagram has been hack into 4 times which I had to reset my password. Would love to keep but for my security reasons I'm having to delete the app. Sucks too because I loved it.Great app really but highly addictive (send help)Not as good as Twitter it's similar to InstagramI can't explaind that this app 100 times better than Twitter 😘😘❤️How to add darktheme: function toggleTheme() { const body = document.body; body.classList.toggle(\"dark-theme\"); }\"Threads\" is such a better name that \"Twitter\" literally means going on about inconsequential stuff. Hopefully this will be a good place for people to talk, but also for people to listen. ❤️❤️❤️ I love you Mark Zuckerberg 💯💯💯💯🙏🙏Add Dark theme & Add #tag trends, trending, & in profile view add also follow count viewPlease add an option to save photos on androidScreen gets glitched after loginThe screen kept frozen.Loved it. I don't want to see all random threads. I just want threads from the people i follow.It gives more options to know more about each other 👍👍👍Loads of fun, information and memesCrashing when posting pic.Tried it for 30 seconds. Very complicated. I didn't even know what I was looking at. Twitter is so much better when it works. I dropped Twitter last week when it stopped working. Technically Twitter is a nightmare. Threads...I have no idea what I was looking at.I really like this app is working perfectWon't let me create an account without downloading more apps.I hope this app will be more useful than twitter soon. Thanks Zuckerberg.This is from my heart, to thank you for introducing this application . This app is awesome 👍👍It would be better if it had a dark modeIt could be a good app if it's feed was better. It shows more people I don't follow than I follow with no way to filter it. The last time I opened the app, it showed a rather profane post from an account I do not follow. So I deleted the app. I like regular Instagram a whole lot better.It's very good but I want song 😭Won't allow a new account. I do not have Instagram. If i do then this is pointlessThis app so good and smooth run in my phoneUseless twitter half fake brother app Meta can't you be more innovative? Copying twitter features?Good job but twitter is better than threads.This is best application for everyone...Thank you Mark 🙏💐Not sure if this is MZ's new alternative to Twittler and False Social, but you can't post pics or memes (so far)Too many random threads appearing on my feed. I don't like Meta making the choices about who I follow. I'm outI am @nritsang on Instagram Is this fare that if you delete threads you will also delete you Instagram account 🥲 This decreased rate of this applicationIt's glitching every time I open itNice New social media app. I'm really loving this.No data Saver option to much data consumptionWhy this app is not on huawei APP Gallery? I badly want this app 😔This app is not working bug this app 😔We need a button to save picturesIt's been glitching ever since I've downloaded itIt is a cheap copy of Twitter no one is morally allowed to make such apps as the owner of Twitter have invested billions in Twitter. I think that Meta should have tried to create some other platformNot working properlyWe need a web version. Please make it available as soon as possible.Can't see any replies to any threads. It always says something went wrongCrashes all the time so what is the pointGood thing that Facebook and Instagram were mixed like TwitterSteals data . A Copycat OF TWITTER . WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE. DON'T DOWNLOADI'm literally addicted to this app it's amazing ima day 1 to😁5***** thank you so much team meta threads, we (30+m) needed this!!!!!Tiktoc ripoff by meta... Google plus was better than all of them.1. you need an insta account to log in, why? 2. i can't log in on pcNice app overall aap campare to Socialsite . I want to Say that all people download app and share your videos and pics .Threads to promote Name,fam and moneyYou can only use this app if you already have Instagram which I don't so can't useI posted so many post.😔 but didn't even get a like.😔 And not reached also.😔Just another cheap copy of twitter. Don't Install this !!Very limited features not comparable to TwitterWhy my Home Filled with Threads by Verified Account? I dont follow them. Please fix this.. its very disturbing.Re: wanting your Threads stream to be only the people you follow. A big step in that direction can be made with Threads' current settings: Tap on the \"head and shoulders\" icon for your Profile Tap on the two-lines menu icon Select Notifications Select Threads and Replies Scroll down to find First Threads Tick the circle for People You FollowThey can only delete threads profile if they delete Instagram account. You are not giving a fair choice to your customers, apparently. We are not even able to hide our badge on insta account. You're taking advantage of the fact that India doesnt have a data protection board otherwise I would have complained about you not giving us fair choices.This is just a copy and paste of TITTER Fk this app uninstalled.🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕Having too much glitchesThis app is nice and simple.I am using this app. I think it's quite good . Mark Zuckerberg well done..👍👍This app is amazing my guys come here to Threads amazing app better then Twitter Twitter was in good hands before know with elon musk Twitter is in bad hands how does know how to handl social media So we have to leave TwitterI love it, better than twitter so far.......It's good overall, but why is none of the accounts I followed showed up on home?App not working proper after installNot bad, but I think the hype around this glorified Twitter clone will die soonso far the app experience was exceptional🫶Nice app , we need dark mood asapCopy and paste twetter alwaysThis application haven't any search bar 😒So many glitches in this app. Bad experience 😞Everthing is good but can u add a messenger for this app pleaseNice app like Instagram👌🏻👌🏻...This app will be become a nice social app.No edit feature? i can't correct the spelling of my postamazing and very smoothI love it this app it commendable awesome thank you meta to brilliant app 👍Please add a \"for you\" page feature so I have a choice to read only the threads of the accounts I followedWould love the option to only see people I follow on Threads and I think this is the start. News say it is currently a mix of recommended content and those we follow, I personally think this is smart as all the other Twitter replacements didn't take off because there was no content while we waited for people to switch or join.Still trying to figure out what to do with this app?? Absolutely uselessIt is just copy of twitter with insta filterIts not working clearlyThis is good app same as twittar bit the size of this app is bigTerrible app. Copy cat of Twitter, and has terrible user experience.Horrible. Boring as hell just go back to Twitter.I used this aap last 20days , and I can say this is best aap to compete twitter 🫨feed is near useless.Its a great app. I'm loving it. Thanks for creating such app.I can't reply post on this app please fixed the problemCongratulations Back True Lion °Threads° Form India Best 👌 Choice Meta Services Look Very Best...App crashes frequentlyThis app showing like damaged display in mobileBetter than Twitter it's very smooth ❤️Another Trash Meta app like a Twitter clone but highly politically biased and censored prob gov controlled.Threads is one of the few app I can recommend everyone to useOkay, can we save images and edit posts please 😑Instagram in a different format .. how is this \"Twitter's\" competition?Need #hashtags. Im looking for conversations about a particular topic. Cant do that on #Threads.Earlier stages but still lots things I don't like about this appThe app is awesome and when the app cross 10 million+ downloaders at that time Elon Musk is crying 🤣🤣 and the app will beat tweeter or i think the app already beat tweeterI can't post a picture, why??Please do message button so people can message each otherIt needs to have the option of viewing only who you followStill got more work to do to beat TwitterFirst of all a good alternative away from the \"Tw\" toxicity. I hope lots of improvements are yet to come ! And plz DON'T allow hashtags (#) . Threads is fine without hashtag. And provide a proper algorithm to connect and share threads with people. And put a News tabs. And I request Threads Team to prevent making this into another propaganda machinery. Just look at Indian Tw., a totally toxic platform filled with political IT cells and bots of the government. AND no misinformation please !🙏No reach for newcomers, already grown and famous people on other platforms get likes and views 😡Great to use also secure form spam and online abuse , cyberbullyingIt doesn't work well in my phoneThis app is good. Alternative for twitter. Have u tried Threads appEats your battery like crazy. My battery normally lasts all day and downloaded this and it was almost dead in an hour and I hadn't even used the app properly yet. Checked my settings and it came up that this app was mostly using up the battery. Unusable if an app drains the battery quickly.I really like the app but I wish they could put an option where you can delete your account without involving your actual Instagram account. It's really a hassle.It's an amazing app.. just loving it !!Please make it to show us post who we follow it not every post Here is a lot of post from everyone to we don't want to see Thanks 😊good better best for twiter , but income source is not define . only threadspls include english translationOnce logged in then u r trapped..u can't deleteLove it so far ... Finally something to replace that other appThis app is hanging up to leassy they have to improve and maker better resultVery good application I wanna say that this app is better then twitterIt suggests me post of people I don't even follow, I kinda hate this feature.This is clearly not for me, sorry mark. Uninstalling.Bugging during scrolling the timelineI expected this app made by Meta as a competitor to Twitter be well thought out and mostly finished. Nope, it's like a modern video game release. Release a cobbled together alpha stage product and then make it usable after months or years. There should be a feed that only shows your subscriptions but nope, there's one feed and it shows everyone and you can't filter out content you don't like. I was constantly being flooded with sports, rappers, and christians... absolutely disgusting.Good Threads, an Instagram appI can't upload my photos what is happening 😔😔😔 I'm uninstalledAwesome experience and interaction.Not properly workingsomthing fresh... best app for social connection.I think it's ok, but it looks like Twitter.Not compare to Twitter because Twitter in office news in this app and in thread to users use to meme and Fun so this app is flop Not to satisfied to people.👎please add translation option😭🙏🏻They can make it more better they should go with some another logo sorry mark thats my personal reviewgetting a high glitch issue plz fix ut asapShady. Can't deactivate account without deactivating InstagramI will uninstall Threads because it's too much copy of Twitter I don't like it 😞Why there's a lot of accounts showing in my feed even if I don't follow them????!!!This is the most amazing app in the world. I saw it on Facebook todayTurn on the reels on threads to have a lot of funApp doesn't load no postSo much better than Twitter. Ever since Elon Musk took over, he's been ruining that platform. Threads feels like a breath of fresh air in comparison.It always glitches when I open it :<This app is okay but I don't know whats the difference between tiwtter and threads now.Can't switch account like Instagram 😞Can't create an account. Utterly useless 😒excellent app,i hope this doesnt like twitterPLEASE add hashtags, I hate getting stuff unrelated on my feed, I need hashtags to follow accounts with similar tastes as me.Good app, but feels bit unfinished and has a some problems on Foldable phones as of now. Resizing when you change screens without needing to restart it how Twitter can would be nice.Magnificent indeed great social media appAn app where the only posts I see are from random people? No thanksIt still contains some shortcomings, which we hope will be addressed 👍Easy and impressiveWhat's the point of following accounts if the feed is just randomized content from people I don't follow?It has lots of bugsHello can you add download the content, picture like twitter do please...Can't give it 5 stars, why is there no way to see who I am 'following'? Or who is 'following' me?When I open the app. The login procedure goes good but suddenly bug appears in the screen and I can't operate the app properly. Face very difficulties to log out and also uninstalling the app is not workingI need to create my account which is not synced to Instagram lolLot of bugs in this application.It's glitching every time I open itCannot delete the account without deleting igApp is not working on my phoneUnable to use it its all fuzzyThis app is great. Hopefully twitter will die. Dont listen to the Elon review bombers. Musk is so terrified hes paying people to bot spam his competition.Great!!!! Amazing social media!This app is perfect for understanding your point of viewThe app keeps shutting down!Crashed. It can't be used.You guys should do account switching faster. Just like Twitter :)My First impression is not that good! I can't log in. Threads wants me to wait a few minutes and try again for last half hour!!!! Are you kidding me?!A poor version of Twitter. Meta should just give up at this point, the company sucks the last 5 years.Rip off of Twitter. Like Twitter but it steals all your data.Erm, home feed full of accounts i don't follow?? Makes this app pointless in my opinionStill needs a lot of workThe error that is thrown in the UI is super annoying. The exact same thing happens to me every day. I didn't think this error would happen that often. Fix that problem.Great app, easy to use.Nice Application for giving collision to Twitter 😃So why can't I see the number of people that I am following? Why am I being shown all of these pages that I do not follow?Excellent Because There is No Direct MessagesLove it, it's really better than TwitterI'm newly download threads Instagram app my I'd :@mutharaiyarvettu_chella_paiyan follow support threads Instagram app member and friends and family also useful appmake better instagram, so then make other appsPics and videos posted should be available for download, atleast those with public settingsGreat app , it's not exactly like TwitterIdk it's alr can be better than Twitter I see the potential,, just that it doesn't have evryone ik rn for that reason I rate Twitter higher than thisSo slow...can't post even a photoThe app is still bugging out i don't know why I can't read broCant even open it without crashing. Can anyone at Meta actually code?The copy and paste technique 😂Amazing another App To make people more Depressionuseless like all the social media platformsIt's very good app.. Need more featuresI think dark mood option would be betterThere is no trending option for knowing latest trending thingsI am unable to login using my Instagram accountThreads nice app and very fast gro aap and all guys install this aap thanksWoah this app is I insane tho I wish I knew more about it. Anyways, I just downloaded it and so for so goodIt's so amazing app I love it. Thanks MetaAn unethical move by Zuck by copying the Twitter app. What is the purpose of ditto copy of an existing app? Just being personal or what? Technically this app ain't working perfectly, full of glitches, wha it should be as there was nothing new in it. What we achieved at Twitter with numbers of followers, do you think we will start from zero here? Absolutely not. Either change the app design, functionality and purpose of this app or take a screen shot of my review. This project gonna failed soon.Bad !!!! As hell. I will say that it can't delete the thread account... You have created instead it will delete your Instagram account too..! You can't delete them separately. You can't text anyone on threads. Wrist feature of thread is the deleting account. Mobs who are looking for thread do not install or create a account or it will ruin both of acc insta and threads's account. I regret getting thread. I think here I will disconnect with Instagram or threads.Since this app is linked to Instagram, it's not possible to use a new user name, but the user name you have already setup on Instagram, which is pointless for a new app. I wanted to create a new user name, but it's not possible here sadly. Also, WAY too much privacy-invasive permissions requested by this app. Uninstalling right away.Why do you have to link to Instagram .. you can brand it with IG, but why link followers from them here.. bad choice .. keep it independent like Twitter and let it grow organicallyCan only login with Instagram account so they are impossible to untangle. Cannot access from desktop, app-only. Wants permission to record literally everything you do on your phone.It has lots of bugsThey don't support freedom of speech if your view does not align with them you will get banned I wouldn't recommend using itThough, It's new but nice app. I'm worry for privacy Because, this app is from Meta 🙂Still facing glitchesThere's a bug where even with fast connection it'll say \"post failed to upload\" or when i post something it'll automatically save in my phone \"which doubles it\" those bugs is soo tiring, as of the moment ngl twitter is better.Can't login without Instgram.Nice app work good some how 😊 better than Twitter I enjoyed this app🙂😊Good but need 2 important changes, I do not want to see people that I am not following them in my threads. second, the fed should be in chronological order by the begging of the threadsI think you guys should integrate this thing with Instagram music, so I can threads the song that storming my head rnVery friendly app ,🧡This app is struggling 😬. Phone is vivo y11. Solve this problem.Just an useless add-on for instagramAmazing Social Media App looking better than Twitter🌚❤Good but there should be an alternative to the story as well.Nice app.. Buh can't download videosBefore You apply read the Term and Conditions. It says You can't delete your Threads profile, You must have to delete your Instagram Profile if You want to delete your Threads profile... And this their Profile reminds Me of the Mark of the Beast 666for me, this app better than the blue one 🤷‍♀️Can't open app it doesen't allow me to enter.Best app but two acount not allowedNeed option to create polls and option to message someoneit's a decent app don't get me wrong. but whenever i try to attach an image, my app crashes every single time. idk if this is an issue with the app or my phone, but i'd like it fixedWow .. This is nice application & easy to use 💖Very good and friendly for useThis app must gain a massive update not too good .Allow login with something other than Instagram. It's mental poison.Need a \"Following\" feed. Need to know to \"follow back\" also instead of the deafult \"remove\".This is very nice and clean app, naw this app my fevarite ❤️❤️❤️❤️THE AMOUNT OF CENSORSHIP IS RIDICULOUS. I'm open to trying new apps and was genuinely curious about this one. However, it's like a Facebook-Jail / Twitter wannabe. The feed shows you mostly people who you DON'T follow. (Like political people that you don't care to hear about.) Threads suppresses free speech and violates your rights to express yourself. If you have an opposing opinion, you WILL be censored. Insane. Worthless useless app.One of the wrost software, I have ever been used. After installing and use my Instagram profile & Facebook profile was hacked and compromised. Generally I requested all of you don't use this application. One more thing if you install it you can't withdraw from your Instagram account. One of the failure application of Meta.This is very useful for me ☺️ thank you so much ....🙏☺️ ❤️Love from odisha ❤️(India,,🇮🇳)It would be better if it has a DM feature.Great experience. Interesting every step.It's a copy from youtube and Twitter so I don't like itBetter than Twitter but still run by another fool.I hope there will be many good features in the futureStill allows hate speech, slurs, and targeted harassment with no actual moderation. Reports are met with \"we're too busy to review your report\" when slurs are at the top of Zuckerbergs own thread. Do better.Please add a dm feature but don't make it identical to IG. Give us smth new :DOne, who is bored with Twitter, can join Thread for some new experiences!!!!!! Plus points with Threads is, it is a part of META, which is growing with rapid speed!!!! Since, Twitter is been an entity of Elon Musk now, it had lost its credibility as Elon can do anything for money!!!! Enjoy Threads!!!!Ya absolutely feeling good to get it with InstaLooking forward to threading+ can play mini game😹Rip Off of twitter. It's like Instagram had baby with TwitterExcellent alternative to that other app!!Screen keep laggingThis logo is as like our Tamil language letter (கு) ku.. Nice don't change your logo type கு கு குJust installed, won't openable to access my emails, sms, and private messages? no thanksBad copy of Twitter. They even using Twit word and same bird logo for it.

But honestly as of the time I'm posting it this has 4.9 star review with no actual comments like did it start as a 5 star lol how is this possible?🤣The app developers don't provide update descriptions that tell you what is new.Meta is still Facebook, threads will forever be unhealthy, and leave you seeking negative attention. Fk the zuck.It's too much fluctuating,Nice app it user friendly I think is the bestThis is the best app I ever seen it's if it is already leading up wow wow wow thanks at threads1st android English review, it's good.Similar to instagram. Good app thoughThis app like Twitter but reach increase in your account of Instagram best app download nowError..... Post are not uploading..Nice app! Better than twitter though! 👍👍Crashes when uploading picsComplete nefarious data scraper. Awful.Can't switch account. Need to log out. LCan't make an account, no option available to do so. 🤷🏼‍♂️The Leftist Facebook tries to compete with Twitter, to mess up with a free speech. Uninstall it , throw it away, just like Target and Bud Light.Best of Luck and can I get Any Online Job ? In this another virtual Jobs Let me know I am interested ☺️Need to add edititable options for posted topicsI don't Have Instagram account how do I login threads illogical logging systemToo many bugs 🐞👾 in this app Cant use anythingDownloading it after Rosé created an acc and its confusing... but lets seeKeeps crashingon picture uploadA best app rather than blue bird tweepI like this app but logo change pleaseGreat and entertaining app, I loved it 🕯😭Meh.... it's ok for now.

But I know already it's a dope app since it's from Instagram 😅Hey I'm not able to post anything with pictures....Do something about itThe Mix of Twitter and the Instagram with the worst content.Great Twitter alternative. What Twitter does, Threads does it better. What Facebook did to myspace, i think Threads will do yo Twitter.....EXCELLENT! Keep it up! Welcome and Thanks!Can't get code to sign up, you only text me six numbersCrashes too oftenGreat! But I keep having a Pop up restricting me from following everyone who followed me please how do I go about it?Could be better than Twitter. Already better in many ways.F***** suggested pages have already started showing from now 😡Best app for daily sad feelingsThreads is not Twitter and is not intended to be. So for folks saying we need this and we need that \"just like Twitter\" THIS IS NOT TWITTER. literally just go to Twitter if you want Twitter features. who goes to Chick-fil-a and says well the fries are not seasoned like Zaxbys - they need the same seasoning as Zaxbys and then they'll be ready for primetime. literally ridiculous. a view for accounts you follow is understandable.It's a very good platform.Is not working. I cannot log inIt's too bad It's not working I don't want to rate it at allMy first 2 posts haven't been uploaded for over 1hr now. What's up?I think that will have to add multiple accounts preferenceIt,s good because if we post something many people seen our postFull of glitches in the app ☹️Facing lots of problem while using this appHave a lot bug But is good ThoughPointless app. Resource hog/battery killer.Dear Mark Zuckerberg I am the first to rate this app 😑 5 🌟 and I like it so far its the first app I opened this morning 😩I like it, it's like Twitter without the N@z1s and conspiracy theoristsVery good app for smart worldUnable to login. \"Not permitted\"It's was amazing app I like this app please i request to thread that please give me blue tick please this is my humble request my Instagram id l_am_gaurav_0001 please give me blue tickI am not think he beat twitter. They need improve many thingsIt's a poor cousin of Twitter... There's no basic functionsIt's like the boring Puritan version of Twitter. Everything is to sfw. There's no action.Nice competetor of Twitter 😈 All the best..!!🤎I wish we could separate our private feeds from the public feed to not be overwhelmed with so many threads from different peoplePlease someone guide me yesterday I got 28 followers and there were too much activities I have done but for the last 7-8 hrs My app is not runningBlocked by no reason And army of bugs thereYou need an Instagram account for it, which shouldn't be necessaryIt's glitching out very badlyvery good can you add groupcopy, paste apps,.... no dark modeToo much censorship, nothing new creativelyLogin option only from InstagramLack of features...Would be cool to be able to search for hashtags...No sound on videoExcellent 👍 I found what i was looking for😊Can't use it, it's all blurI can't post videos since 😏😏😏 failed failureIts good to have an app like twitter.Same as Twitter .

Where is the option to see my followings only?Super app it's given more computation to TwitterLooking great !!! Competitor to Twitter.Wrost app properly not working my phone 😡😡Need to get the media content to downloadOnly accounts with blue tick and big accounts who can get attentions and traffic. No one will see your post/thread If your account have low followers and don't have blue tickI'm going to use this app,I hop this new platform will be useful for you guys.I can't login Why need to login Instagram account fak appInstagram copy,twitter still the best💪💪💪Great app ,I'm so glad to join threadsThreads is good but this app copy of TwitterBug for me, slider bug'sDownloaded it yesterday.

When it's legging???Brands ruin the app, it feels weirdly fake.That what's a good app for like twitter on the thread what a good for a future for fallower now.Great app. Elon musk's twitter is in danger. Mark 1 Elon 0.Its not useful to spend time better one is twiter👍Best platform right your thinks and Your Opinions, suggestionsWhy this app have bugs? 😭 I can't use normally.Need to improvement like # tag etc..Worst App ... total Copy Paste 🤮🤮🤮 I wasted my 2 minutes For itVery nice and wonderful application🫡♥️The best app recently...i suggest everyone to be part of this appReally eager to see the good stuffGood app, I hope Threads will going better than Twitter.If you like it, everyone should download it. Sorry twitter good bye🤣Very poor UI 😭There is nothing new. Everything is copy of Twitter. This is not fair.The app is excellent and Owsm ।। From -Kishanganj (Bihar)Yes this is a very ecilent application for the world 🌍it's okay. I'm going to give the app time to growThis apps are very interested to work 😄I think it's better than Twitter ❤❤❤So I recommend you to download threads❤️‍🔥Good app. Better then musk twitter that is about to get drowned😂❤️I love this application & after Instagram this application is ky favorite one.Simple. To the point. It was Much Needed.Never again to mark zuckerdicks socmed app.Lol what the hell is this zuck needs more data buzz of meta Twitter is bestAs I open the app it starts glitchingWhen I was want to post something then the app shut downWonderful app I love the UIBoring tbh! Zero engagement, zero likes, zero comments, zero everything!!! I think they should promote or suggest user accounts apart from celebrity accounts!Lack of features...I really don't understand what this is, but it's fun🤣Need some basic ui interface updatelmaoo it is like Twitter but in a simple wayThanks for meta wonderful aap I am happy😃 for this aap and enjoy 🤓 gys enjoy threads✌️There is no reason provided for updates, so I provide no reason for more than 1 star.Il stick to twitter. Too much.One problem here... When i write comment on post and reply on it then not showing postIt's normal actually twitter is way betterFeels like a safespace for people that can't argue their \"feelings over facts\" point of view and censors \"wrong think\". Reminds me of a dollar store version of a name brand product.Great app Great features 💯Please broadcast my Videos properly that I can get more Followers.What about those who don't use Instagram and want to use threads????? It just sucksTwitter clone, copy and paste, shame on Mark, he could come with new and smart ideas, zero starWe cannot edit the post once we uploaded my suggestion is to give this option@Mark Zuckerberg : Please resume my FB and Instagram accounts which is suspended for no reason. I already have downloaded Threads and want to use it with my old Insta account only. PS: Have already rated 5 starsFaltu App. Use Twitter instead.Jumps out of the app in the middle of writing a threadFeed packed with content i do not follow/wantIf you enjoy censorship and data collection this is your platformIt's a fantastic app ever will this app take over Twitter 💫Crashes everytime i try to postThat's okay 👍 let's see if it can help me grow my brand cuz Twitter has definitely not da Wave 🌊Best app and easy to use 👌Can't use because Instagram account is lockedActually threads it's so easy to use. I really like the app... I think it might be my fav app now... P.s I'm the first review here 😂Either so much error or some other reasons, I face, as I logged inBest Social media platform To Shareing Own Activity...!!Will come back when there's a following feed already. And goodluck with the Twitter thing.I just started and the app started glitchingadd headers plz that would be soo coolKeeps crashing when commentingBe nice if you can import who you follow into this new app.Not able to loginI was nice app...But we also want trends in theseNowhere near Twitter + very unpolished user experience!Decent replacemt for Twitter but feed is 100% people you don't follow and no way to see those you do.Too much bugs.your thread failed to upload every time i try to upload a new threadBest app so far that I've used. I recommend you to join threadsI'm just here because my boss over at bleeter told me to come bad mouth this app. Also I work at lifeinvaders, you know freelance and my boss there also said go one star that app its gonna ruin us.It's is very easy then Twitter so we should use threadCan't login without instagram accountIs this only for Instagram users? Should user have to create account insta, and then have to use this app.Threads on ; the best way to trend ministry, business, passions and so much MORE. I dominate this threads with the TRUTH 📍 of the Gospel. Meanwhile, just curious tho with the threads' logo (666?).Better than Twitter but some have boringthe app is glitching its giving me a headache meta pls fix itUnistalled as doesn't want Instagram account.First review from Bangladesh. Hopefully it will be broke all previous records with good reputation.They should add a save thread option asap!!!Already loving it. Can I expect a lite app?It's a Superior Upgrade Version of Twitter. Welcome To Earth 🌎Instagram is good 👍 workGetting crashed for no reason..Its good but i need free blue tick please give me 🥵✨It's not displaying any posts. Not even off people I follow1st review on threads app App achi h pr thodi km information logo to bhi add de skte h but don't take sensitive data from us. Thank youI feel more like twitter, but good appMy feed is nothing but people I do not follow. I can't find the people I do follow in my feed. What is the point of following themThis application is really good and might beat Twitter soon.Too many bugs!!!!I don't know how to explain it but i like it more than twitter😂First i liked it cus its same as twitter but then there are some probs also like theres no chat option another n big thing that u cant dlt ur thread acc if u wanna dlt so youve to dlt ur insta acc too so pls fix it metaLove it!! Great alternative to Hillbilly Twitter 🎉I always get random posts on my feed. So what's the point of following others?It should be for non instagram users also.Excellent app instgramNot able to view any postGood App but make more improvementK can't even touch anything on the screenLow quality copy of Twitter!cool app, good for all in one chatsEasy to use, better than TwitterNot opening properlyAwesome app neat and clean loved in on the first use My thread is : ivan_hugs_tvFree ads (for now 😭)Why it should play video automatically?I Love Threads, it's better than Twitter.It's like a mini Instagram!Can't log on without instagram acctThis app show like mini tweeter & in this app not new thingsLags too much. Closes itself everytime i try to comment or quote any thread.It's the worst parts of Twitter combined with the worsts parts of Facebookso far it's a dope app. better than Twitter fo shoThis app is so cool I like it 10/10 ten out of ten 💜💯💯good app, maybe can add #trendingI don't like the interfaceScreen flickeringin my mobile when I open the appIt's was an excellent app I personally used I and like it thank you sirThis is not a good app. Rides on another app increasing risk of data loss and unwarranted exposure. Hangs, crashes at will. Junk at best. Parmanently deleted.Just another replicated version of Twitter and Instagram. Didn't find the app really exciting or anything new Plus seems the competition was only to prove who has fastest account holder which mera have achieved successfully offcourse by their marketing strategy through Instagram. Else won't recommend the app to anyone Just another TIME WASTING MACHINE which forces you to retain your account and cannot be deleted willingly. #privacyconcernNeed to fix the bugs on the app. Can't load my profile, can't make a post, can't refresh my page. Also, maybe consider allowing users to download media straight from the timelineWhat about those of us who do not have, nor want an Instagram account? It would be nice if I had the option to create a log in specifically for this app. Fix this issue, and I'll be sold...possibly. Uninstalling at this point.The app is nice and I really like it more than the other app that I installed. But, sometimes the home tab was lagging. But I hope you will add something that will make the app more trendy and fun. Thanks!Uninstalled due to being forced into having to make a Facebook account just to make Instagram account just to make a threads account.. stupid! Shouldn't need all that unnecessary rubbish! The app should be it's own separate thing.. not having to sign in by using another apps..See I'm totally against copying the already great thing which is existing and using it as a rival. This is a waste of efforts by humanity, I think we should be more focused on inventing new ideas and spending our energy towards that incentive rather than copying things!Keep on needing to reinstall it, saying I'm unable to log in everytime I log out and that the app has a bug. The concept is really good, but still needs a lot of improvementExtremely bad app. Has been screen lag from last 3 days and tried many time to fix it by redownloading the app but still doesn't work. Extremely worst expreience.Since I've logged out and uninstalled this app I have tried to post on my Instagram account. I can't see certain photos or things I've just posted but my total number of posts are correct....I just can't see them. Could be a problem.Couldn't even explore the app because of this glitches. Even for a small touch it starts glitching. Couldn't rate more unless the bug is fixed.This app isn't so bad for a first launch but there could be improvements like longer videos and no glitches also this app is way better than Twitter because with twitter you can't get as much as you can with Threads plus you can't see who your following or add city and state plus add category or contact options like Instagram otherwise than that this is a great appthe app is useless it cant save pics and the home button wont show the post of accounts you follow, only bunch of strangers... they need to work on their algorith and like there are so much to catch up on before launching this app.No point using since I can't customise what I see on my feed. I don't want to see all the possible posts from the multi-verse, only from who I follow. I have zero interest in sports, don't follow anybody in sports, so that showing up is an instant uninstall.Boring, wish i never downloaded it cause i can't delete my acc without deleting my IG, Facebook ( meta now ) as always never bring something new on the table since 2014, high expectations just tl find myself in a boring cheap version of Twitter ~ at least be a little creative with your apps and stop copying other apps to stay relevant ( Snapchat - TikTok - telegram - Twitter) and get us something new that may get our attentionstop trying to use an algorithm to guess what content I want to see and just let me view posts from people I follow. Twitter is a nightmare and it still allows me to do this. it was bad when you did it to Instagram and it is still bad.I was super excited but you can't sign up for a new account you must use an Instagram account. It claims you only need an email but once you are done creating your account it immediately requires a phone number or it just freezes.Good potential but too buggy and not enough features to be useful. Will come back when they've had time to sort things out.I feel like this is just a copy of Twitter with nothing new or sepcial and it's even worse.. I literally downloaded it just because three of my favourite content creators are on it. You didn't even try to make new designs or buttons or features like what is this?Once upon a time, this app had the swagger of a superstar, but now it's just begging for a standing ovation from the exit door. The hype train has derailed, leaving nothing but a ghost town of deserted users in its wake. If boredom had an official spokesperson, it would be this app. Time to bid adieu to the good ol' days and embrace the exciting world of apps🐦that actually deliver on their promises!There wasn't any need of half cooked app in hurry to compete twitter since app is lacking in loads of basic features. Hope devs are working hard to add features as well as troubleshooting the bugs.Well I downloaded the app only to find out afterwards that you have to have a Instagram account to log in, and there's no other way around that that I saw, so 1 star. If it's fixed, then I will re-review. I don't have Instagram and I'm not getting it either.Very easy to use. Can you add download button to image in every user threads? Because somehow we want to save the image they sent to us. Overall is great!The app is good over all, needs alot of festures but since its just new, its understandable. What i didnt like on this app is that, if you dont have that much followers on your instagram account, youll get zero engagements on your posts. Its very hard to grow your account and i dont know if its based on luck but its really hard. I posted consistently everyday, got no effect.I'm failing to install this app on my phone despite it being compatible with my device. It downloads 98% but then crashes and I get the message \"cannot install threads \" 🤷🏾‍♂️Doesn't work as a stand alone platform. Wasn't interested in getting Instagram but to use this you must have an Instagram account and then if you don't like it you can't delete it without deleting your Instagram account too. No thanks.Why its connected with Instagram.. i installed it and open account from insta. Now this thread badge is shown up in insta's bio. I Removed it many times from there..but its again shown on page refresh. Please do this app independently from insta...or i uninstall both the app..🙂Mine keeps crashing when I @, quote or add a photo, tried uninstalling reinstall restart phone..... Nothing on Google to say what the issue is. Phone works fine with all other Meta appsDire. Installed and uninstalled because the flow of it isn't upto scratch. You get random posts in your feed. The data collection is very bad and intrusiveI downloaded & found it requires an Instagram account so just another gateway to an app i dont want. Twitter at least was stand alone but its policy on needing a mobile number puts me off using it. So Ill just stick to meeting mates for a drink & having real conversations with out enriching billionaires further.Well i use Facebook the most and Instagram sometimes but they both have the same passwords and I was on this new app earlier and now it's saying my password is incorrect.. so I'll just stick with Facebook I guess. Wasn't a huge fan of Twitter or Instagram to begin with.This is just a simplified Facebook. Nothing else. No chronological order sorting and no way to filter only those who you follow. I'll just stick to Twitter until y'all decide to give users what you want.I was super excited to try Threads but i was super disappointed with it. My feed was just full of suggested post of people & things that didn't interest me & that i didn't follow. Hard to find the people i did follow. plus i can't search topic's. I'VE NOW DELETE APP. 😥Had to uninstall this app as my phone started acting up after installing and using the app for two days. My phone kept on ghost tapping and scrolling or other apps would hang.What the point of trying to be a replacement for twitter when the app doesn't allow you to only view posts from ppl you follow on your feed and doesn't allow any nsfw content. This is just an even more sanitized and advertiser friendly version of Instagram...This is one of the worst apps in the list of worst apps I ever used, I don't wished to be here just got here cause a friend asked me to and now I can't delete my account neither can I use this app and it is collecting some useless data that a chatting and connecting app doesn't require, I do wish it gets banned in IndiaWorst experience I was curious about the app but the moment I downloaded it I just regreted so bad the display was getting a glitch I don't know how it's hard to explain what was happening it was kind of crashing I never felt the app normal when I open the app it shows a glitch kind of a pattern of Matrix like appearence and it's so badThis app froze first, then it got repaired, and afterwards, my Instagram is missing so many posts from feeds. I've reported multiple times, still no result.It very good alternative for Twitter. Need space feature and trending page. It great if you able to add shorts like feature.This is worst.. I downloaded for the first time(ofc) and it is showing a glitch and not working properly... I keep on refreshing it but it doesn't work and shows the same glitch over and over...It doesn't support on my phone, everytime I open the apps, it gets bug, and I can't see the thread clearly, it's like a piled up sentence everytime I scroll.Why does this app need so many permissions? I permanently deleted Facebook from my phone because somebody told me that I was online, but i did not open the app that day. Why would this app need biometrics and reroute phone calls and reorder running apps and see your health fitness and what other apps you have and activities you're doing and all of that?? Never going to use a meta app againDid not understand this was an addon to Instagram, requiring an Instagram account. Since I have no Instagram account I can't even check it out. Why did they tell the media about this? It's clearly only for Instagram users. Seems like it would have been more appropriate to inform all Instagram users directly.I just found a much better alternative to both Twitter AND Threads. Everyone needs to download Tiblur. It's on the Google Play store. It allows media and lets the users have more say than all these promoted brands.Didn't find anything new, it is just a lite version of Twitter with very less features which are simmiler to Twitter, but people still want to join it because they haven't seen any new and big platform since last few years and they are bored of using TwitterSmart, convenient, easy user interface but need some changes as it could look different and may print unique identity.Am yet to experience it because it has been malfunctioning at my end. After login in, if I try to scroll or click anything it will just start shaking and creating multiple words from others post.I can't delete my account, they have tricked the users. And I can't even remove the badge from my Instagram account. It's like they are forcing to use this application. Losers, come up with your own ideas, stop stealing and copy pasting stuffs.Combines the worst of Twitter's \"For You\" with Facebook's \"people you may know.\" Scrolled for several minutes & not once was shown content from the people I actually follow. It's only promoted content from verified accounts.Sending friend requests is buggy... For some reason, it sent MULTIPLE notifications to all my contacts Would have been nice to inform me that I couldn't DELETE the account without also deleting my Instagram account... beforee i signed my soul away.The app is nice. The only thing it lack is the trending page and obviously translation features I follow alot of creator that doesnt speak English and the translation features would really help.Be sure to read what data collection this app gets access to. There is NO reason for it to need that much of your personal data. Also interface is bad.it has some problems, as an example, in home page is kind of mixture direct and explore. I didn't like to read anybodys writing about anything.The app no one asked for! Don't really understand why this was created and who it's aimed at? Seems very similar to, if not, a rip off of Twitter (which I also don't have!) I can't see where it fits into the social media space and am unsure if it has any unique selling points? Uninstalled!There should be a way to delete your threads profile without deleting your Instagram. It should also not need to even attempt to access, let alone store, nearly as much of my data as it does.Awful experience. No DM's. Always recommending people I don't wanna see on my TL. To top it off, I got suspended for posting a very structured and well mannered opinion of the App. I never had an Instagram Account until yesterday. I never will again. Don't trust Meta/FB/Instagram/Threads. Just another App to gain all your info. You only have to look at the settings to realise how much info they want from you. Disgusting. Also shows regulators are fine with it. Don't install 👍I deleted the app after two days. You get too many threads from people I have no interest in following. To get rid of those threads you have to block each one individually. The app should allow a user to start with who the user wants to follow.Not a fan, seemed decent at first but I don't want to be spammed with accounts I don't follow. They fixed the deactivate so it doesn't mess with IG, so that function works.Trash app aimed at mass censoring. No freedom of speech. Wants to compete with twitter and musk, what a joke. It's extremely easy to use because it's so bare, boring and empty. More appealing to watch paint dryCan't search for users Have to scroll all the way up to refresh, no pull down to refresh. Have to click multiple times to see reply to a reply. Didn't get get any activity from followers on my post. Unclear if they are inactive or not seeing my posts.Hi, threads team This app randomly crashes on this Android phone. Like, double triple screens , overlapping etc.. And if I can send u some of my screenshots that would be helpful for youWhat is the difference from Instagram and Twitter? Copy paste doesn't solve anything. You should have come up with an innovation. Downloading 100 m + is not a success like me most of them will delete the app and wont use it.Screen glitch! After installing the whole screen glitching on my android device (pie ver). So I uninstalled now, will be install after a month. P.S. I tried install-uninstall the app, the result is still the same.Just lost all the excitement of using this app...for last 24 hrs I can't load posts or comment on a threads. I tried reinstalling, clear cache nothing works. Best I can do is view and like that's it. So frustratingI don't like the fact that it's automatically linked to your Instagram, what if you want to start a fresh and run a different content on thread. Useless app.I'm sure it's lovely, but I don't have an Instagram account and thus, am not allowed to use the app. Being that it's based on mastodon... I'll utilise mastodon and remain without an Instagram account.the data privacy thing is violated through and through. you can really delete a thread account without deleting your instagram account and the deactivate option-- you can deactivate only for a week. it's gives you no real option of leaving this app.It sucks. It stopped allowing me to post anything with \"post failed\" since few days and \"something went wrong\", i updated the app and nothing. Other than that it really is just boring afSucky. Keeps picking up my phone. Clicking download on more devices only brings up my phone, not the tablet , I'm on that I want to download too. Have tried periodically all day.Don't want an Insta account so have uninstalled this! Let people create an account with an email address and I'll try it then! At the moment total waste of time.There's a bug. All fonts were overlapping each other and incomprehensible. Looked like a glitch effect but horribleI can't read my profile and can't write anything as a message \" something went wrong\" keeps appearing. Already tried to delete cache but it does not solve anythingNot a fan that the only sign-up option is to use an Instagram account, instead of letting you choose to a Meta account. Funny considering it says very clearly at the bottom \"from Meta\".This app isn't working properly. I don't know why but the threads of every account is mixing up on screen. I am not able to read any of them. So check this and do what can you so.The app is not working well.....whenever u scroll the screen it starts shivering automatically all the time..... Unable to read any post... Fix this problem as soon as possibleThis is an additional flavor 😁 yepeee self expressions..self care 😘I don't really like to see what is out I like to see the individuals inner vibe.. that's why Threads ultimate alliance and a real closure for the verification and the rest is history.after just a few days of using it, my instagram app is getting bugs and errors, my account can't be opened and it's really a problem for me. i hope this is fixed soonIf you're using this aap don't use it . If you connect this to your Instagram profile nothing happened. If you deactivate your threads profile . You see many issues on your Instagram profile . I'm facing that problem. . don't use this worst app . Non worthy ......It's not working smoothly. even when i open this app and try to do anything the display looks like it's broken I don't know what is the problem but it's not a good app. its totally uselessBogus app. No option there to disable auto play videos or managing the quality of photos. Very poorly copied app.Installed for the experience, Uninstalled after 4hrs... No Follow tab as such... Can't delete the Thread Account specifically as it's linked to Instagram... So apparently whoever joins thread gets trapped... They'll have to delete their Instagram Account to delete thread account... Do something new instead of copying others... Wasn't Stealing people's data enough?I LOVE IT. But I uninstalled it because 1. Why do people have FOLLOWING button if all they can read are stitches from the people they didn't follow? 2. Allow a tab to separate strangers from FOLLOWED people of an account. 3. Allow photos to be saved in phones. 4. Light mode please.Uninstalled the same day as installing it. This is just another addition to the ultra-intrusive suite of applications from Meta. There's no way this garbage is even touching the feathers of Twitter.this app is number one rubbish app because i created my id on this in office i am not able to see anything neither i am able to login my account nor i am getting to see some new interface in this full account instagram It is visible from although I have not created an account and have written a new profile and a new resume.It is trying to compete with twitter . But legend is only once made. You cannot copy that. Twitter cannot copy facebook and facebook cannot copy twitter. Both are best in their fields .It's was an amazing notification on my phone as I was active on Instagram so I downloaded it and used, the app is amazing attractive, it's now my best app after IG but you can create it with the same username if you like it as Instagram We're the first people to get used of thread ✊Poor imitation of twitter sans the features to back it. Given, it has raked in app installs, good growth hack piggybacking on instagram but the user engagement isn't to write home about. Uninstalled after a day.So: - No ability to download pictures. - No following feed. - 500 character limit, whereas Facebook's is around 30 thousand - Does not allow NSFW Needs a lot of work. Don't bother yet. This is not a Twitter replacement.Nothing about this app feels good. No novel features upon launch, no way to make money on the app, just feels like a copy and paste Twitter with the most random algorithm ever.Images make the app crash and so I've decided based on it's immature layout that looks like from early 1980's websites ! I'm seriously not impressed with this app .The worst app I have ever experienced.. Despite providing correct log in details this app is showing incorrect password...I am utterly shocked having experienced this from a reputable and top company like meta.I think app needs more Updates as because when I open the app and when I scroll down the words are glitching too much!!! Which we can't use the app Properly !! So please Improve this ProblemDo NOT download this app. This is bloatware and once you go to uninstall it, you will have to delete your Instagram account as well. Basically, it's a trap created by Mark Zuckerberg.Only want to see people I follow and not everyone else's feed. That's part of the reason I don't like Instagram as much as I use to. I don't like being forced to have other people's post show up on my feed when I'm trying to see what my friends and family are up to.Trashapp. Had to sign up twice and still getting banned or under review after i have written the code on a paper received through my email and phone and also took a selfie. Like damn what else is there for a new user to verify lmao. Meta is a sensitive weakarse company who will never be better than twitter. Update: threads finally let me sign up and verification completed. I hope they don't piss others off but I give them 4 stars. Minus 1 star for pissing me off in the beginning.Way too many bugs. If i change my IG password in locked out on my threads and don't have the option to simply re-enter my new password. Everytime i use the @ function to tag someone in a post the app kicks me outThere is a problem when I open it, the interface breaks and the writings collide together. Please fix it as soon as possible. Thank you very much.Why Threads doesn't allow us to sign up using our email address or phone number? We don't want to use Instagram account to log in. Hope to add this feature in the future. ThanksThreads gives a sets a perfect example that if you product is poor, no godly amount of money on advertisement will help you make that business thrive. Threads is that poor products, who had Instagram to promote it but it failed badly coz it was just dogshit and unnecessary appI give this app four stars because this app is like Twitter.Same to same not anything is change just name or some feature you have to download but this app just launched about 3 hours ago so wait and download after sometime s this was a problem to old phones Thank you.The amount of private data that this app takes from you is atrocious. Also, you can't delete your threads account without deleting your Instagram as well. Why are those two accounts tied together like that??I dont use social media a lot and wasn't planning on using Threads at all. I just look at my homescreen and it was installed on my phone. I have absolutely no idea how it got on my phone but I have now uninstalled this app and InstagramI think the app is really easy to use and it's a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. I also like how there are so many different features like filters and lenses that make it fun to use.we really did not need another app with the same features as before , there's nothing wow , or a new diffrent catching concept ro it , writing post and commenting is doable everywhere . beside even the users are sharing the same things as the other social media . and it takes so much useless spaceBruh the new social app rip , same as twitter but with better UI but the biggest flex of twitter is open speech as u can give ur opinion on anything and their ceo is also cool , this app also collects lot of data and also there was nothing new just twitter users posting same content here also so it's a big fail.For everyone who continue join threads, but people don't want it, it's not good. This app must have some option for delete threads acc without delete ig acc permanently. This bout it cause some people just want to try/interest with this app w/o knowing what happen afterRubbish wish I could give IT a No Star Rating but then again where could you put Zero star rating 🙄 and let others know.....you need an Instagram account to login in, this resulting in more data collection 'privacy out of the window collected from Facebook Meta team!!!!'Very bad experience it's looking very bad glitchi screen..even I am not able to use this app. And i am using Android 9 as thay mention requirement from Android 9 To upThe experience was Meh at best. I guess I was expecting more with all the hype. I deleted the app when I saw how much data it's collecting from my phone. No thanks Meta.Simply not working. My internet connection is working fine but the app just keep loading. Tried to uninstall then reinstall but the problem persisted.this app is annoying! i try to delete my account, you cant. i try to remove that number from my bio you can't. this is wrong.. i should able to add and delete apps if i wanted to!!!Missing basic features, no feed for only people you follow, no way to tell if someone is following you on their profile, and no web client. I'm not going to use social media that I can only see on my phone.I will never download this app again this that has so many bugs and people jumping in while you're talking on Instagram privately if I was to recommend this app I wouldn't do it I definitely say it ain't worth it and the trouble that you going to do don't download the appReally disappointed The app doesn't work properly and glitches, whenever i scroll the app glitches and every thing (letters, icons) gets doubled and move up and down and make it like old broken tvJust feels like a really bad clone of twitter with less features. Biggest killer is the lack of a web version. Deleted in less than an hour of downloading it. Even with twitter on the downfall with Elon's dumb decisions, its still wayyy better than what this is.For two full days now it has not updated my scroll. I have been seeing the exact same posts for more than 48 hours now, and when I do get a notification about a post, it's from 2 days ago. What possible use is that?Really a good app I inspired by Imran khan to com threads appright decision this app is very useful and will leave twitter behindKeeps crashing, screen stops midway. Also, had to uninstall to make space. But now I can't reinstall it 🤷🏻‍♀️App is working good feeling good Go threadsI don't know why but suddenly my followers shows 0 .. worst appAmazing application like Instagram i loved it 🫶💯Fix the bugs of facebook and update recovery system, instead of launching new features/projects day by day. Facebook is becoming worse after binding with meta. Stop copying others and upgrade your existing serivices.Nice replacement in case twitter goes down againNice app but Twitter is better than thread 👍👍👍The app is lagging too much i can't even see my profile,go to the settings or see followers and anything. Maybe it's because the app is still new but i hope this problem will be solved soonMany features are missingApp is not stableJust came out and is already better than fascist-controlled musk's twitter.Not good just feels like a clown 🤡 of twitterGood,but performed not good in my phoneThis app is very simple i love itIt's a very good app. So easy to useNeeds chronological timeline option.I love you guys! Such a happy place. Thank you Mr Z! This is perfectionGreat initiative. Hopefully there will be more improvements in the future.What's the point? Facebook already bends to authoritarian and corrupt regimes like Turkey, Iran, Qatar, etc.This app is not at all workingIt really feels good while using this app....Very basic and it takes way to much of your info. You also must use an Instagram account and once you link it you can't delete it without deleting your Instagram account.Fast time using. I don't know what is actually in this app. Twitter vs threads game chal raha hai 😅😅This is very good job from metaCannot save pictures of any account. 1 starWoww.... its so amazing... i like it...Needs a save image optionI will say nothing but .... The important thing is the app is very niceNo Cover Photo Option And Many Missing 🥴This is a very good app that deserves a lot of appreciationThe interface is a big problem. Right from the point where a user logins in his or her account; the app feels cluttered.It keeps crushing and logging me out even on my Instagram accountI changed my Instagram pw and can't login to Threads anymoreThis app is pretty calm and easy to useMark did a great job with threads. Just peacefulBest for only those who are already popular on InstagramI want to post a pic but it auto exits.It needs a lot of improvements , however, for now, it is a great app .Just copy and paste of Twitter nothing specialThat's is cheap twitter , I don't like the interface , it's looks similar to instagram , and I want to stop using Instagram , this will make our generation Fully addict to social media, it's more dangerous than AI3 stars so far since I want to request to add some features present in Instagram like sending DMs, and having GIFs to post. Moreover, please have a language translation function also, so a lot of people can connect with each other. I would also appreciate it if the news feed or timeline can only show posts/threads from the accounts you are following. please make this possible thank youIt's Simple twitter by Instagram with connected with FB whatsApp and instagramRequires stupid amount of permissions, can't delete account, and looks awful. It's a very disorganized mess.Nice application like Twitter But this is awesomeVery very nice app and good luck workSo far the app is great. Easy to use.It's very interesting better than twitterI am so happy team Instagram come thread app so good I am happy 😊My insta account has been crashed after downloading the threads from Instagram app. Waste of time, Twitter is best instead. I had worst experience with this app.the bugs are so bad, I can't even read a single threadworthless and useless app I don't found use of this app for people , Its just an arguments with twiter , i hate motherfather 😤Its the best but we need more updates on itsuch a waste app. I can't even scroll the feed it's disgusting...Very very good app... I love it ❤️So very very safety app so please used 💖.....It requires an Instagram account. which I hate. I hate Instagram = I hate threadsVery Similar to Twitter , but I like itMcctttwwww My phone can't download the App since day before yesterday. When it reaches 90% download it will just stop. Don't know the actual problem.Please make it possible for private textsnice app jusrlt need add stories and chats👽💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕Pointless app why let me follow people and then just show me posts from anybody but the people I followIt maybe a great idea but the disadvantage is the log in using Instagram that is what made me hate it because am not an Instagram fan but am on WhatsApp and Facebook. To be fair why don't you allow login using either of Meta accounts be it Facebook, WhatsApp or Instagram. I feel like it's discriminative to non Instagram users.amazing just stay here for a long time now and beat twitterNeeds pixel fold and tablet supportI like It. I like it alot!Give all people's one star till they don't allow us to delete threads account permanently.. it's a big scam guys so give only 1 star.Still not used this , but it already created alot of hype among community 🤍☮️ well going to use it and. Further update my review guys ...!Thanks to MrWhoseTheBoss for telling me about this app. So far so goodAbsolutely unhinged madness, 6 out of 5 starsEh, just installing because Elon is so annoying.Very good app to use, it has all to useWhy must I have to own an Instagram account before I can use this app?Please Fix the bugs, My Bio is not changingGuys stop moaning it's new app it will improve soon . I couldn't stand twitter 🤣I love this app so much it's better than Twitter not gonna lieHas a great amount of potential to replace Twitter. Which has been ruined since the Musk takeover.That's Great app, it powerful to beat TwitterI'm Install this app in 07/07/2023 this is very good application..We don't want to see such this apps, enough!Nice experience better than Twitter great job mark zuckSeeing the spread over news about Threads Feature and I shouldn't have thought about hear this, so why not I'll give it go, what else are you gotta do?Dont download this app if you want to let your instagram work properly, as I have downloaded this app and started my profile with the same username as in my insta. But after 24 hours my insta app start getting CRASH , However when I logged in with different account on my insta app it works properly.Awesome app and much better than Twitter.....I'm not able to log in. It says \"please wait a few minutes before you try again\"Thanks for this app. I was looking for twitter alternativeThrash u need an Instagram account when you're in Twitter you can be a ghostClean version of twitter. I like it.Jjc...hoping it will function to expectations .I have no doubt actually. Judging from your previous apps.App is crashing!!!!!!After using this app, my account in Instagram keeps crashing, but when i use another account it's fine, ig its because that account is connected to threads, please fix it!!Ooo nice and this is also crossed chatGPTFinally a perfect app.Anything to force twitter to be betterThis app is not working good.. I'm really disappointed.If they don't agree with your post , they will restrict your account . Twitter dominates . Plus, you can't delete your account unless you delete instagram. Screw MetaGood app, go with this. Far better than TwitterThe app is cool but Twitter is on another level 🙌It's very easy to use .I am not interested is seeing the posts of people I don't follow and there's no option to get the off my wallSuch a amazing platformToo much not needed permissionsNot interesting platform.So far this app is good but my feed gets full of people I don't followSuper App just go for it.. ✨✨Good start so far but I don't want to see anyone other than who I follow on my home page. There's a lot of irrelevant randoms on there and I've been blocking a ton of people so that they don't show up again.Very good, I don't understand it yet, but I am tryingSearch, hashtags are terrible need to improve, Twitter is faraway from threadsThis app is really awesome i think its better than twitter🥰I can't post any picture from my gallery, when I select the photo it will stop and back to my home phone. Please fix this kind of bug.Great design and all, but has a lot of bugs. It behaves weirdly on Android 9, unusable..I congratulate Meta team and Mr. Jukrburg hopefully Meta team will win with Musk and team. My best wishes and God help them. Threds is really nice one and now i don't need Twitter anymore in my device.Something went wrong when it used for 1st 3-4 hr don't know what had happenedIts so fun actually, love itIt's an amazing app share your thoughtsVery nice app thanks for creatingToo bugs in app right nowUser friendly app. Useful app for gaining knowledge.I hate Instagram app ,if this app like it ,I will hate itIt's good? Pamalit sa Twitter hahaha but may mga bagay that i don't like, like their is no darkmode, and their is no [not interested] in every post that i don't want to see meron namang mute but parang ang harsh naman nun hahahah basta 50:50 you need to prioritize the DARKMODEVery very very buggyThe app just doesn't workThanks to Instagram for beating Twitter by creating this beautiful applicationFresh installation and it won't even open?Hoping this is the first review on Threads. I'm installing it now so decided to give it a review. It's already a great app lolWon't let me create an account and no options to help with thatVery beautiful ..... Twitter bye byeIt's fun, but it can be funnier if I suggest adding free data to this app, like Facebook has,  for people who don't have daily internet at home. Thanks! i hope u notice me, Mark!Application need further developments and new features.The app's concept is great👍👍Very very good aap batter then twtr Threads is very helpful appSupport Android 13 Themed Icons on Launcher, c'mon threads!This is Larry a Great App and is Less Toxic rated this five starsplease change the feature where we can delete our thread account without deleting the Instagram account.It's something new something fresh I like it I still like twitter too.Pretty much I like it what I want to write.Literally i don't know about this app. I install it because murshad Imran khan sign in on this app. Love you murshad Imran KhanIt is a new app,I'm still experimenting it,i will give adequate rating laterAdd translation of textsI think More people busy in download the threads & check the features. That's why here Zero review. Im the first review . Let see how it's work ???This would be a new platform for youth. Excited..Better Than Tweeter and more Andvance than Tweeter📲The volume of videos is automatically muted. Hope this problem will be fixed very soon.The user interface is not good. This is ultimately an unwanted attempt. Build something new fellas. This can never replace or outperform Twitter in any manner.It's actually nice and i'm enjoying it. I hope it will remain untoxic, no dms and unable to see followings because these are the things i like. If there's something i want to add and that is FLEETS so please hear us🙏Its glitching plss fix itI don't need suggestions .i wanna see what i want .not what the app showed meElon musk's app is better , we want freedom of speech not your propagandaI've tried multiple times to log in by using my Instagram info, and it keeps stating that he info is incorrect. It isnt worth any more of my time. ,🤷Just useless Twitter is far more interestingI say only, it's very nice app Thanks METAThis app is requiring that I add a Phone Number to it for \"security\" purposes, I ain't doing it, so either drop the data gathering or drop the users.5 star if i can finally search posts using their captions or hashtags and if i can embed vids/pics like twitter 🧑🏻‍🦯🧑🏻‍🦯🧑🏻‍🦯Right away it wanted me to link my Instagram account with it, and wouldn't give me an option to use a new account that had nothing to do with my Instagram. Hell no.It's a good platform for socialize as like Twitter. But Today after 6 to 7 hours of installing the app got closed till now it is showing try again. I uninstalled.I logged out but when i tried to open the app back, it keeps crashing since morning. I uninstalled it and trying to log in back now.Copy of Twitter I think you forgot to add the space option 💀 But it's k for Insta Ki Public 🕊️🤺🤧 ( Jisko Twitter ka nhi pata )Bro feels like i got another same app, and that's starting with 'T' also 💀No way to sign up from the app. You need an existing Instagram account which I don't have and don't want to install just so I can create an account to try threads.As Amazing as it looks!!Twitter loses control of their ability to suppress information, control speech and the narrative so Zuckerberg, the kingpin of the suppression ring rushes out a poorly made app to see how many people will willingly allow other people to tell them what to think so they can try to regain control before the next election. I downloaded this app and uninstalled it without even opening it because I prefer to think for myself. #1 app when it has a lower rating than Twitter? Right. Whatever you say.Nice to show informationWhen it has more features, I'll give it a real review.Just waste of time Twitter is far more better than this.It's disorganized and u can't even see posts from who u follow on ur feed. Also theirs no way to filter content on ur feed. The mute and block r ok buts it needs more filter options.if I could I'd give it 0 starsIt's a amazing app then twitter mind blowingNot a good app as compared to TwitterNice app to connect with worldIf a thread user have a Private account, please make sure we get a pop up while we click on unfollow, saying \"Are sure you wanna unfollow them\"..So you Can't enter GIF on this App??Pathetic app, a bad copy of Koo App and worst copy of Twitter No hashtagsA beautiful program, sweeter than TwitterWhen i was follow someone after refresh it automatically unfollow but show in my profile that you was follow himJust loved it more than how I loved twitterI want translate thread function in app. I can't understand threads of other languagesFor god's sake remove the followers and following feature facebook system was betterIt doesn't open whatever I try I don't know where is the problem I tried to delete and istall it again many times but there's always a flaw I hope it will be fixed soonGlitchy, somehow worse than twitter right now.Mark is my role model,anything from him,i always love it.I couldn't even use the app, it's been bugging since i installed it. Texted everywhere on the screen, pictures crushing with other pictures...Installed threads just to annoy Elon Musk. Best app ever.Why does mine keeps glitching? Pls what should be doneIt is great app .much better then elon twitteris pretty sweet at first glanceHorrible. No one needs another toxic social media app. Take your questionable and harmful privacy policies plus data selling machines elsewhere Mr. Zuckerberg.I really like this app. Instant of TwitterI like it and all. It's my fist time posting some threds since I do not have twitter but I hope in the ext update they'll have a dark mode. It really hurts my eye and it's so bright.Simple, and straightforward. And no Musk!This app is a replacement of Twitter in a way and can also give competition to Twitter in future and who knows if it can be removed from the competitions.  Mansoor ArifHot trash tbh. Why am I not allowed to see only the people that I'm following? Why can't I download any media?Loads of threads from people I don't follow. Might as well go back to twitter.It's good but no friends available hereSuch a amazing app, nice algorithmNo autoplay settings not as smooth as twitter and it's kinda dumb sometimes. It should have been somethin good for news. But it's apparently not.The permissions that this access and the terms and conditions we should agree with is really scary. It's just stealing our whole damn personal data.Reviewing it on first day of it's launch. Hope I'm not disappointed.Please don't copy from the twitter. Elon musk, always our inspiration and our idol.Need to have chat box and following check up optionInstalled it to see what the fuss was. Could not create an account - must have existing Instagram account. I don't use Instagram. Uninstalled. Shortest installed app ever.I love the app so far But they should please put the dm option for usStill Twitter Better No Save Button:-)Useless app if we try to delete thread account, it will also delete our Instagram account as well and it pathetic and uselessLike how they freaking copy it. It should be stopped.Don't create new account and password I want to make for safe with password please why don't help me kooThreads is literally Twitter pre twitter files release, lol so scuffed feel bad for u sheeple out there falling into the same trap. Its just more media controlled by big corporations and 3 letter agencies...First few days it worked well and now it doesn't load at all. I've tried reinstalling and clearing cache etc without any luck.It's not better than Twitter By threads my lovely Twitter I'm back on Twitter!!!!🙄There is no option to delete your account unless you delete Instagram It's privacy nightmare the app collect everything all my data on my phone I don't feel safe and there is nothing I can do about it It was trap for me to download this app and i fall in itHappy to be one of the first people who rated this app . 😂 I think it would be on Top in the future 🙏😁Best app ever I have see 100% saveIt's forcing me to use my instagram username. I'm not able to pick a new one. I think the platform should be a little bit independent from Instagram.How dare you? In your wildest dreams, even in a million years, to compete with Elon, sometimes it's easier to give up.information app 👍 nice features 🙋It's Amazing App. Sure it'll beat Twitter.Worst 👁👁 the app is not responding properlyI can't really tell you what the apps about But it's cool 😎Flaws: - Login with InstagramBest social app I think this gonna be better and bigger than Twitter.Really enjoying it, but I keep getting errors that only seem to be fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling, like 3x a day.It asked me to logim with Instagram but I don't have any Instagram account. It should have options to sign up using phone number or email id. This app is a cheap version of Twitter.New app are installing but I like Facebook and insta thoDownload!!! Definitely a new experienceI just want to see my following's post not others whom i didn't follow... Muting didn't help too Please fix this issueIt is an amazing app I love it so much 🤩❤️Best experience Twitter ex employees doing great work 😉😉😉😉😉Perfect just perfectNothing but a cheap copy of Twitter...Not great yet. I had trouble installing and then I couldn't see the app so I had to uninstall it in Google Play store as well.And the app crashed for the first timeIts a good place to refresh your mind but the problem is moneyNew handles for Instagram? That's interesting.... 🤔🫡Same people different app. We are at the saturation stage that all people are doing is transfering everything we have seen to yet another platform. Influencers are desperate to be the first big thing. Same people, another home.Felt like I'm in mix of twittah and inst, but only the worst things from these apps. Really tastes disgustingExcellent work of Mr. zuck, Thank you threads team. ✨🌎👨‍⚕🩺🇺🇸Too much usres data is collectedI don't have Instagram. I can't use this.Threads is very best app. developers good ❤️Better than twitter... Lol 😂 But copy of twitterNice app though I couldn't changed and add a profile picture all of a sudden, why is that? Hope u fix it as soon as possible! Thxliterally most useless app on play store 😂Where are trends in Thread app? Koo app is much better than this Thread app. Thread app is actually a trash app. Twitter>Koo app> ThreadNice like a twitter and this instagram eco system was very niceVery good but not working twetarI hope they surpass twitter cause oh my days is that app garbageThe fact that one cannot delete himself from it seperatley from Instagram is alarming. It's kind of useless, no point. Boring.... No hastags... Just for corporate to advertise their own means.there are a lot of bugs on this app. when i tried to scroll down the text getting blurry and unreadable.I really hate it when you are scrolling and pausing on a post, it would trigger text selection and it's so annoying!!!!You have to login with Instagram. I don't have Instagram account.Nice application, more interesting 😃not good. I don't understand why this aap is created?They should not have linked threads to instagram. Followers on threads is synced through instagram by default and if you remove people on threads they get removed on instagram also. There is nothing extra this app provides apart from instagram and twitter. Seriously don't think there was an actual need for this app.Twiteer is worst app now a days. This thread app is awesomeSo far everything is great...good job 👍I've just logged in, I hope it will suits wellI cant uninstall this if I uninstall this instagram will automatically deletedMany problem when i start this applicationLoved everything about this social app. You should try it out too.❤️Don't download this app it is crashingWell, So far, I like it.. Still figureing it out..;)Y it is asking for my insta account? Both r the different app.. should b login different.It's very exited to try something new app like @threadsI loved this unwanted child of Twitter and RedditGreat application in social media world. Love you meta 😘😘Very good social media platformI dont know how to feel, so its like a tamed version of twitter with the people you follow on insta? I dont get itThis is good but not as twitterI don't want a discussion persona associated with my Instagram persona. If there's a way to separate them I'm not smart enough to figure it out so I deleted Threads. OkIt's just Same thing as Twitter....it's clearly cheating 😅Lame it's just another AOL instant messager waste of timeThis is an app that doesn't allow you to delete its account without deleting the IG account. Boring as hell. It's Just a clone of Twitter. However, Twitter is much better, i believe. Wish I could give '0' star!!! Happily deactivated and uninstalled it forever...Just take a look at what data is collected.Twitter is better thanks to Elon. Threads is run with bots infected with the woke mind virus.I don't know how I'll get my followers but it's good app for time waste 😝😝Meta trying to make his Twitter is a failure, the only thing that makes them especial is the overcontrol in the privacy and the banning, and that sucksthere should be an option to download images like twitterLovely app. I'm enjoying every bit of itI am excited to start the journey with the new app 😌very nice app ceiling small like twitter ✨💫\"I've been searching for a platform that allows me to connect with people who share my passions and interests, and I think I've found it with Thread. Excited to be part of this community and see where this thread takes us! 🌟\"Here we can't edit our own thread. Let's see are they gonna bring this feature sooner or later!Best app like twitter but I am very happy 😅This application collect many types of data collected from users like that personal info, financial side, shopping activities and device idA lack luster, feature deficit, copy cat attempt of liberal stank feces.It's most big plate form I like it ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Threads break the record of all over the world 🌎 in the download speed 🚄. only 1.5 hours in 1 million people download this . #threads#instagaram@threads@instagaramThis feels like a cheap Twitter copycat. Content flowing into my feed are so random. I couldn't search for content. Oddly, it feels like an echo chamber too.It's just a stupid version of Twitter Zuckerberg just pressed copy paste againboth threads & Instagram cant login together. if login with IG,threads will auto logout. Already do clear cache,clear data & uninstall then install back, the result still be the same.Try to copy Twitter more. Maybe by then, it can succeedLags so much when try to postBest to use. Please not take money from users like elon. ThanksThreads not properly workingCan't even get into it I don't have Instagramlemme explain what scam this is, It will not deactivate even if you deactivate. also, when u want to delete that stupid badge on instagram page, it will appear tone after time after timeeeeee!!!!Best app against Twitter calm environment non toxic than Twitter because twitter become so toxic. Good step taken by owner of Instagram 👍👍Looking for an app better than twitterAmazing you can connect you Instagram acc to threads which is nice.5* rating.....It's a better than twitter nice app! 🙌Thank goodness this exists and I could leave Elon's dumpster fire.Make it so that we can share out threads to Instagram post, not just storyJust downlaoded it today, looks great to me already...So far so good I hope in the future there will be an option to see what are the trending topics on threadsWhy i can't add two accounts in one device?It's nice but we can't switch accountsStopped working after a while o:I will happily download anything that could help Musk fail. 🤷🏼Starting with one star by default, let's see how it progresses.Embrace, extend, extinguish. Ditch Elon Musk or Zuckerberg and to for the open source alternatives such as Mastodon.cheater! Why can't we delete this account without deleting our Instagram, trash company,Threads is more like TW+IG but liked it.supper cool I wish I could pin my post and favorite certain people I followA fully functional program and better than Twitter, thank you Mark ZuckerbergThis app needs more development from its featuresNo dark mode settingA low quality version of TweterI can't seem to log in to this appHow is this garbage supposed to compete with twitter? Imagine actually using this lol, bro literally copied the same UI and hoped for the best 😂 Zuckerberg is an actual clown.App keeps crashing when trying to add a photo to a post. Samsung Galaxy S22 with Exynos 2200 SoC. Pretty good other than that.I don't want a threads account but I want an Instagram account...why do I have to have both? :(Best app on the planet keep bots awayBro don't ask about it, don't let it come with an insta app, I can't believe .. Brother 10M plus login in just 7 hours on threads appApp keep crashingIts down within hours of its inception, unable to post new threads, check followers etc, This is how u will compete with Twitter .?This app is going to be the world no.1 messages brandI love this platform I think it is better'than TwitterGood apps and easy useIt's good, I hope it gets better with new updates...Good experience instagram and also thanks for this ❤️My threads are having a bug or technical problem.I don't like that your actual name has to show up on here without your permission.First to review. People are slowly coming and app is good. The interface is also good. Easy to post threads.When will it be able to get for Kindle Fire? ...I can only get on my phoneIt's kindaa fun to use but what is it use for mark bruhhhhhu 😂Very happy to see a competitor to Twitter.Because this app is only login with Instagram account why?I wish i could but i logged off Instagram by accident a while back and cant remember my log in. I asked them for help and they shut me out. Glad. Good riddanceThe first to evaluate the application We wait a while and prove the evaluation with better accuracy A very smooth start to the programmeNice app 👌 easy to useBest app as compared to Twitter Good job done by the Mark Zuckerberg.Too early for an objective review. But then just a few observations: -There is no option for dark mode on the app -You can't interact with the DP of ThreadersThe app install and i set it up just fine but when i start scrolling the words and contents glitch so when i keep scrolling the words leaves stamps/trails of it self so i really cant understand or see the app clearly. Is there any way to fix that ?Superb..this app and amazing things and best fuchersShocker, I was censored pretty quickly, Twitter is where I'll be! UninstallingLooks like cheap copy of instagram.... Not even bit closer to Twitter. Its so cheap my words cant explain it. I was excited for it but it ruined everything. Tooo cheap quality.It was 10m last Night when i downloaded now in just 1 Night it's 50m😂❤ Congratulations guysThe restriction on following people should be uplifted. We unlimited access across the app.I love that musky has nothing to do here and conservatives can't spew fake news.It's still bug everywhereUgly and looks like a beginner designer who works on thisApp is not working on my mobileWhy Home is full of people that I'm not following like artist. It's tiring mute and block one by one. No Feed option setting for that too. Uninstalled.Twitter is good but nice threads 💐😀I hope I didn't rush the review but it's excellent so far.Nice one...really enjoying a lot😌🤍Very good idea and app Until nowSo nice app but is a blink me Please help me Instagram teamsVery bad app only glitch ho raha haiWorks as described. This app can easily takeover TwitterI think this app was good. But this app more improvement upcoming updates 😊the app shows us posts from people we don't follow this is so st*upidFirst to comment on Mark Threads. So far, I'm loving it. Kindly follow @glimmmerkids and @unusuallastborn for perimum contents.very good app but i give 4 star cause this app is copy TwitterIt still need a lot of work on itDidn't like the UIAnother heavily censored, Trans pedo loving app by the personal data selling scum that own insta and Facebook. For christ sake DO NOT use this app.Add thread *pinned 📌* feature , That would be very coolThis application is very good & AmazingGlitch on Android 8.0No way to just follow friends. Sooooo much spamThis is just entertainment only not compare twitter💜💜💜💜 Very very good app But upgrade required Thanks 🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️Experience is good i love it and yesterday i saw a meme that mark Zuckerberg sat on elon musk grave and show victory sign✌️but at that moment i can't understand that but now i understand that meme🤣🤣Useless app. Twitter is much more better.An impressive piece of Spyware that's good at circumventing firewalls. Another app you'll want a separate phone for. Aggregate accounts and corporate shills are what ruined Instagram as a platform, and Threads is a celebration of those things. A great app for stalkers and law enforcement in states where abortion and being gay or trans is illegal.So far, so good.... Just need to get friends on here.Not bad for a first try, but there's posts from folks I don't know (and don't give a fig about), and the bloody videos auto play. Nothing like using my data for Meta's ad services, eh?!Basically a fresh start of twitter. but its ightIt's Is Not Good Very Bad This App.👎🏻❌When I want to delete this apps account Instagram account is also deletedneed an option for room chat or spacesTwitter clone but a very basic oneThread is best experience for our brand and small business to spread the content, sales and growth the businesses 👍🏻This app is amazing! CongratsssssThis Application is as Good as Instagram. We can post videos, pictures, Threads here. Overall experience of using this application is good and I would like to recommend this to every Instagram user. MUST TRY AT ONCE .How about adding a toggle for dark mode 👍A app with the Hardware of Twitter & The software of Instagram.Very Bad and Boring 😂Add a trends section, this is the cheap Instagram, make it threads or insta or merge both And please add Dm section pleaseGood very experience great hard workingThis is very lovely app 😘 we lived it 🤩 Thanks Instagram 🙏 For this wonderful app launched 🤗Try to add download featureSimilar Twitter but awesome interfaceNice Good its looking different from other aaps ✌️❤️I don't care about posts by people I've never heard of, or movie gossip or other garbage I'd never follow willingly. Why is it not possible to only see posts from people you follow? Or disable autoplaying video? Absolute trash app.Imagine twitter but with way more instagram tweens in there.Its so annoying!!!!! I can't even delete the number from my Instagram profile and it looks so ugly. U can't delete ur account without deleting ur Instagram account which is stupidity annoying. Like omg fix this issue cause its the stupidest update ever!!!!!!!!!!!!I Don't use insta. But this looked interesting. You are cutting out a whole base that could boost the app.Must to put the translaterNeeds a lot more work....Forcing us to use the app i just installed and it links my account to my main insta account and now I can't delink Or not even remove the thread id from my insta bio and can only deactivate the thread id. Worst way for promoting an app.Worst app if I delete it due to some reasons it will delete my original account on Instagram 📷Need more features that twitter doesn't haveIt's just better than the birds 😜It's more then better twitter Elon Musk waking up in the morning seeing #Threads Trending on Number 1:I'm enjoying using this account, but i hope there's dark mode.\"Translation\" option please. IG and Twitter has it so why Thread fell short?I can't run it in my phone, i don't know whyVery nice app. Also I am the first to review this.It's awesome.But there is much to improve.I hope it gets better soon.Great App 👍 Better than Elon Twitter, Thanks Zuck 😇Good app Don't have any ads I like itI don't hav Instagram account neither do i want to create one. How should i login?Cool app, need some polishingJust like twitter But benefit is to be a new and starter of the thread appA good start but there is no hashtag option, no multiple account option and the interface is just messy like there's no organisationThe interface is so poorly done. Could be better. Right now it looks like a mess and makes me not wanna spend 5 mins there.Please give us upload and download high quality picture and videoSick of apps stealing data & using it for their benefit. ×.×Half way using, i got prompted out from the app...App is working good though 😍👍🏻 I'm impressedLooks like this Journey would be fun. 😊My phone is blinking when I scroll it😥😭Closes the app in the middle of typing or to post.i would imagine its really good, but it forces you to sign in with instragam. no other way of sign in. i get its owned by meta, but come on, cant i atleast sign up with google, or even a phone number since they also own whatsapp?Love the app it's amazing bye at last something newTerrible and boring app!!!I will not talk much but really best than twitter🐦🐦Much better than Twitter and i also liked itPlease add the \"confirm all\" feature in the follow request. 🙏Crashes on Fold 3 5g when uploading picturesVery good app.. Superior ❤️when I want to upload a high-resolution image, it definitely doesn't work and force close.It's glitching just when I logged in my accountNeeds lots of improvementsIt's need to text seen viewersThis app is very goods esy to use i lost of love😍please upload an option to unhide the threads badge. Thank youIt's like Twitter, but with less Elon & Friends.Can't post with any attachments.. tried everything...reinstall..tiny images..clear cache..just won't post. \"Failed\" eveytime... plz do a desktop version too.Great Experience After this I had Uninstalled Twitter.This app is the best one till date. The best social media app. I would say. It is intimate but social. It is like really connecting to people. I am addicted 🖤Controlled and censored by the same dicatorship as fb and ig. No thank you.Doesn't load anythingLike Twitter but slightly worse. No page for just people I'm followingThere is a problem in my app it's not working properlyApp is so glatching i am not able to useThreads needs hashtags and the ability to see trending topicsI personally doesnt like how this app worked...It's amazing Love it #instaloverYeah because now that Twitter's Free Speech we're going to make an authoritarian website basically identical to Twitter but now we can weed out what we want and make people act and say what we want and we dont like something we can make it so no one ever sees it.Unic and outastending appwow It's an app that we love and are happy to useMark Zukarburg always create history ❤ this app is so clean and usefull..This app is very useful. I suggest you all must use this app 💝😘Couldn't use the app as soon as I opened it after logging in visual bugs, texts over lapping like seriously what is this evenThe most restrictive use app that i have ever seen in my life.Doesn't allow to remove it's account. & It's badge from Instagram is also not removing. This is not even close to twitter. Trash app!!The app is crashing.Seems OK, bit strange and differenthey! i just want to let you know that make it like Instagram as if any celebrity comments then his or her comments shows on top..Crashing for every minuteIts twitter bro dont use this app ita just for wasting timehello sir this app so very good support my account ❤️They just copy Twitter and I would give it 0 stars but it wouldn't let me give it 0 starsHaven't used it yet. Wanted to be the first english review.Not interesting like Facebook or InstagramThis looks crazy definitely become competitor for TwitterMy app is not running clearlyHave fun seeing what the people who made the app want you to see rather than what you want to see while your data is being sold to the govWe want this type of app to thread 🧵 and follow the legend all around our world.Nice and simpleEveryone should just see the data collected by this app.Twitter is better and reliable than this app 💯I used it for two days. It felt like a mix between Instagram and Twitter. It's very bad. The feed is the worst part about it. Which is the only thing it does.Nice... ADD GIF OPTION IN COMMENTS....This is a badly designed version of 2010 Twitter. Terrible design. You can not delete a threads account unless you delete your Instagram. It's like a forced relationship.KEEP THE QUALITY OF THE PHOTOS MARK!Great app free from paid bots😍It's literally just your instagram account crossed over to a subpar, basic app of censored content of people whining. Can't change your user name or anything and if you delete your new Threads account, you delete your Instagram account with it. Terrible features, bad vibes, limited features, has no grand or promising feel. Disappointment. You will be hard-pressed to find anything interesting on this app for years, not worth waiting around for. You will see selfies and nothing insightful.A lot of crashesThis app very good but so give me blue tick ❤️❤️ Farhad khanIT CRASHES EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT I TRY TO WRITE A THREADFull with bugsWhitout instagram I can't login in this app It worst to use 🤬🤬Another Facebook ploy to try to steal your personal info and sell it to other places.It's just an amazing app .... Really nice 👍Best app and very active followersVery nice app bye bye TwitterI love this app very best quality..What going on Thread! I can type but I can't see me typing a comment under any post that includes a photo/video/GIF.Absolute trash, like all things Facebook.. meta.. related it's garbage. Also read the fine print in the TOS, you don't own rights to your posts. Deleted.Its good because its free thats about it.Can't install the app after numerous attempts. I have plenty of room on my pixel phone. Keep getting error.can I see the photos and videos designed alone, can we go live video, pleaseI think some of yall just need a new phone ☠️the tiktokification of social media needs to stop. i never want to see content from people i don't follow - that's the whole point if following/not following people!Great addition to InstagramThe stupid App crashes every time I am selecting people I want to follow. Must I follow everyone I'm following on IG??Gosh... The glitch hasn't disappeared. I have tried everything. Uninstalled and installed it multiple times. Nothing helps!Great app for another addictionAmazing feature in threadsIt's a start, à decent one. Let's see how the next 90 days go.Very good app highly recommend 👍sorry Elon musk 😉Application are very useful for knowledgeTo hell with this fake twitter and how the hell do I uninstall it without risking my insta acc.I don't know how to grow account in this platform ??? If you have followers on Instagram, you will still enjoy threads otherwise no entertainment & no like on your profileThis is the mixture of twitter and Instagram.not bad not badVery interesting and addictiveAmazing and wonderful applicationI have got a Threads, it is awesome appIt's a really good app and I love it❤️Good App. Good answer of Twitter.Nice app for the first time ever sinceI have no issue with this app, it's running efficiently. Just waiting for more new features. Going hard on TwitterGlitch is happening in this appI am getting less followers. This app looks good but messenger is missingEasy to get startedI can't post anything on threads. It just closes up. Fix it pleaseVery Bad ₹295 you Debited My Cash Loss. Don't Install This App your Cash is LosseThere's a problem with the pageCan't use Gifs... Google Pixel 7 proI've never come across such a forced application. Very odd experience. They want to be Twitter but it has no soul. Twitter is the OG and back to Twitter for me.It's actually really nice. And people are more sane here. And being themselves.Twitter if you like your data processed by facebook and doesn't care about free speechI didn't find anything new or unique just another normal app.No smooth appThank you.i am happy. Bcz another app for spending time... 🥰App is trash, created an account and it got immediately suspended. Not even worth the effort to try to fix, just uninstalling.Loving it so far ... Give me a follow @4k_king2022Make GIF insertion supported.Good app as well as Instagramthis could have been a feature on IG instead bruv.There's no feature to explore people's tweet, homepage is just a bunch of random celebrities instead of people who i followed, no hashtag feature. Big big no.Monopoly is dangerous for human being and world also.It's a very Good app.. Threads is better than Twitter maybe!!I will give this app 5 star nice app from meta good workPrivacy will always be an issue when it comes to Meta Universeit is a good option to opt twitterits a good app to start with fightGlitch in screenPls add replies hide option I am trying to flirt with girls and my friends going to my profile and see my replies and like and adding comments that's not good becoz me trying to flirt with his sister ☠️Add a function to migrate instagram followers to Threads!!IT'S IS SAME LIKE INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER BUT IT IS SO COOL BABY BOOM😉😉😉 AND IAM THE FIRST REVIEWER OF THREADS APP ON PLAY STORE BABY😋😋😋😋It's good till now ..need more featuresGood....

Very nice.If andrew tate doesn't have a threads account. So Twitter better than threads!please don't use threads app only use twitterold features, nothing newI can't change my theme to dark mode..الريفيو رقم 29 في تاريخ البرنامج The Twenty nine Review in the app's history.They deleted my account because I said this won't compete with twitter. It won't! Get better not bitter!!A promising start . But put some featuresWow Instagram have come again with ogbenge 😆 I will come back for more stars if need be🥰Worst, Just copy and paste instagram code to threads 😂🤣🤣🤣not as much as good as TwitterThis is the best replacement for twitter!This app monitors way to many items through your phone. Fourteen to be exact. I refuse to agree to it. So I uninstalled the app.Not as bad as I would think for a Twitter rip off so far honestly 🤷I'm having trouble login in using my Instagram accountAfter installing thread and activating account my Instagram account is getting crashed constantly as I start the app It gets crashed. Is it only happening with me ?In my first experience with this app, I think it's greatgood and smooth appIt's an unnecessary product and looks so overloaded and I don't like \"some\" types of people here saying anything about anything. Useless, period.Not bad. But no need. Another time wasting app.I downloaded a game about a button and the button game went off my phone faster. This is literally Twitter except empty because no one is using it yet so start a thread so this app can have textNice and smooth 😄Very entertaining app so funit's not fair 😢 😔....when removing it,also remove my instagram account.Well.. Thank you so much for your special serviceI think this app is much much better than Twitter!!THREADS brings sanity back to tweets! Now can really say goodbye to twitter!Very slow appIt doesn't let me stay logged in to both Instagram and Threads at the same time. As soon as I sign into Threads it logs me out of Instagram and vice versa.Boring... its just like instagram nothing newNeeds major development and arrangementFive stars just because it can potentially break twitter down and send Elon Musk back to his hole.App is nice and unique.I like it🙂Watching this app rapid increasesMake it more smoot and i will give it 5!My experience with this app has been fantasticCannot use without an instagram account 👎This App is a place to be, according to Akon. 💯%....Very well designed appMark needs to lose his ego, and trying to own everyone, and everybody, including the GovernmentI pick my boogers while reading threads. Good appHashtags don't work... how people see your posts? No one sees your comments since there's no notifications, and no number by the comment logo.Nice app implement hashtags and discoverThere is no create new account button. Device Samsung s21 5GA Nice platform to form new threads and I hope it will not spoil like Twitter..Better than Twitter the UI is so comfortable and good looking as it can share the same posts to Instagram and the story templates are so good looking ❤️It's just a cheap knockoff of Twitterreally bad,i can't even readsCopy paste boring app same Twitter My recommendation Twitter is bestHaven't used it but elon musk is fatter than Zuckerberg so I'll give this app a higher ratingAwesome Easy to use Love this appDownloaded to see what the hype was all about, sorry to say but that twitter is just better, atleast I know with twitter everything I read is genuine, it's easier to use and with threads it really just seems like the wish version of twitter.Good app but this was same as the app of twitter, But easy useThreads is place for all of us to be. Fantabulous real time conversation platform to beIt's dope, albeit a work in progress.Good complement for TwitterSteals all your data and censors free speech.Downloaded it. But I could feel my data being harvested and had to delete the app. Data harvesting, plus heavy censorship.. double bad.The app is so lit 👌🔥 I love the app so much thanks markİt's useless thing, we can do all this on normal instagram apoTheir is no difference in Instagram and this app, both are sameI think it's more interesting than Twitter ✨Not a perfect app,Happy to Join With @threadsapp ✨ And Proudly Says From \"META\" 💝 Thankyou For Your Greatwork 🤍Hi threads !! I have an issue once I login into Threads, I get logged out of Instagram. And if I log back into Instagram, I will be logged out of Threads automatically.  please fix this issue I want to use threads as well Thank you.I changed my password on Instagram, now I can't login my threads accountThis app requires near criminal levels of data collection and oppressive permissions to your devices. If you value your privacy at all, delete it immediately.Best application replacement of Twitter.Apparently an Instagram account is needed, so not for meI'm proud to be amongst the first 200s reviews for this app.Need hashtags, DM option and Trending page!Cannot login with Google or emailDo you know when we delete threads profile & data. One will need to delete Instagram account as well 😞😞😞😞😞Nice app working good.Awful amount of permissions. To delete account on threads, you must also delete account in instagram. This is a way to force people to keep their account on the platform. Awful.Barebones but I like the feel of itWhere are the Hashtags?? And the trending topics or Dm (Meta version of course). But without that is freaking useless...Dear Team. Not sure am I the only one. But in my app there are too many glitches. I use Android. I hope you can fix it soon. Thanks 👍\"Sorry, something went wrong. Try again. \" My entire threads experience.Can only log on using Instagram. What about the people like me who don't like nor use Instagram? I'm not going to create an account just to log in to this stupid app.Poorly done app, and once you realize it's bad, you can't even delete it without deleting your whole instagram account. Strongly recommend to not get this appI have no idea what this is about, but I am unable to loginUPDATE dark theme, thanks!My thread isn't working properly please solve this problemWhy you need my health, financial ,email ,web browsing, call logs data ??All the best and welcome to worldVery useful app I hope everyone come hereVery interesting app. I'm liking itIt's nice app I guess you should download it 💯💯✌️Do not download this app it take your healthcare information if if you thinkin you're in it for life you cannot delete your never everYou need to show how many posts a user has and how many reposts a post has.I feel like you guys should an inbox. It will make it betterAwesome and worth supportingDon't marge with Instragram. If you marger with Instragram so product make a worsted.....It would be great if you can add the feature foe logging in multiple accounts at the same time. Just like instaBlue bird bad. Threads good!You can't compete against Twitter if you sensor and have horrible data access policies... Who are these \"independent fact checkers\" that pop up on my posts?For quite a new app,I think Zuckerberg tried his best.....I give it a five starFirst Review, it's an good app lets see how it competes with the Musk.Too slow, useless AppWorst App I Have Ever Seen Copy Paste App From TwitterNah cuz this app is trash ong Even as a Twitter copy it's bad asfAmazing app. Much better than TwatterI don't want to have to have an instagram account to use thisAmazing app. Kinda enjoying it ♥️good cus there is no reels 🔥Cannot uninstall it deactivate my id when I delete it. Worst privacyTo many permission for an appBetter than twitter, amazing appThis app is so much better than twitter Thanks Zucker bergDon't have an Instagram account and was no prompt to just make an account for this app. Maybe they'll figure it out later but currently useless app for meReally such a great app.. Now it's not been a lack of Twitter.. this thread have have all the opportunities that other app can't have.. Great app and Good job Zuckerberg for developing such kind of app😍It censors posts and gives warning on conservative accounts lol. So much for a twitter killer.no dm button, and I can't see the ones I don't follow yetAmezing this app but chat option available in threads appI feel Thread should have improved 'Switch Account' feature for seamless switching between multiple Thread accounts without Instagram approval each time, for greater convenience. 💯UI is great 😸Very use full app thanks InstagramIf a person removes thread badge on Instagram there should be an option to get back that badge, i mean there's no sense why not you het that backCan't even view threads, it keeps bugging outTHREADS IS PURE TO GREAT THINKERS.. IT MAKES YOU LOVE SOCIAL MEDIA... FOLLOW UP AT SUSTAINERS TRUSTEE CHARITABLE MINISTRIES Lastly @meta please add the messaging button and columnI like free speech unfortunately this is ran by people who don't agree with it.I think it's way more better than twitterIt's bad it needs more repairs 👎Awesome this apps absolutely right.Not many data is present people just use it as a next gen Instagram that's only but Twitter have many database and easy to use very good features in Twitter threads is very very lack of data compared to twitterBugs everywhere ( android user)Make it at least to turn around on big tablets.Nice app ☺️ but give me verification batchSo far it's working really wellApp does not workI love it...it’s easy to use Love YOU Mark Zuckerberg for this you're a sweet man i have ever seen we can connect each other using new technology you're superb man Love From laksam,Bangladesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩Love this app !

If this is essentially a thread adaption FOR Insta, why make its own app. Wont be using this if i have to make an account for a social I don't utilize. Add another sign in method.Please have a section made for the people you only follow/discover page. It makes no sense to follow someone if you cannot see due to the algorithm.This application is cool and best because I am like this applicationCheap twitter knockoff. Can't delete account since it is linked with insta and doesn't work independently. Will never come close to Twitter.It's lame as hell.... Just add features to existing IGAwful, just a bad copy cat of Twitter, bad privacy policyThere's no messaging option 🙄Complete trash.

There are people I follow somewhere else. We will see 😊Instagram account holder only login thread whyIt's twitter but actually goodJust a china copy of twitter. Mark should create something of his own rather than copying stuff from others. Example, reels from tiktok, concept of stories on all his platforms which was copied from snapchat and now he copied whole application of twitter and gave it his own preferred logo and name. Btw the name Thread is only used in twitter lol.Very good app😀11/7/2023There is a bug when following at home and following directly on the account profileYour app has been copied and named as tweeter 😀👍Good app easy to use . I like itbetter than twitter + the users are so so friendly its now my fave app igAs usual, Mark is stealing other people's ideas, one star for this one, for suresuck mark .why you need to take many personal infovery good social media appThe app is too censoring.

What a cheap trick.Instagram ka notification bar niche kardo please 🙏...Feed saved option neededAfter installing threads , I could not see my Instagram feed and it is not recoverable . It is the worst app ever .Ever since I installed Threads, it has caused my Instagram account to crash when my followers increase in threads, and I can't access it, maybe restricted but idk why if you cant make an app why make it ? Fix my instagram and your appsWhy would I be seeing post or Threads of people that i don't follow?, can you please change it somehow, I want to be seeing only threads of people I followJust mediocre. Because of this app I can't use Instagram anymore because it crashes... \"All of a sudden.\"You cannot delete your thread account. If you did, it will also delete Instagram account.Nothing is interesting in the app. I was expecting something new.Trending page is what makes Twitter addictive.... Threads lacking thatcrash many timesDoesn't charge me to use the app. All I needIt's just a cheap copy of TwitterLack of features that supports a discussion space like tags and better algorithm. Prematurely launched.Simply doesn't work. Too badTwitter need competitor for improvement.This is really amazing ❤️ i like thisNot interested in creating an Instagram account. Also, where is the website? Only an app version? No thanks.

Love itVery useful appGood experience l love it 💥Definitely better than Twitter 😀It's a copy of twitter , the app is launched to compete twitter,as mark Zuckerberg is a part of matrix ,decides to cancel the people who open minds ,so there is no freedom of speech , Zuckerberg doesn't know about privacy and decides who to ban and who to not ,can't ban woke but bans who are against it with the point of you ,Really amazing and thnx @zuckA very good one AppJust amazing appThreads are better than twitterZuck needs to actually make his own appWhat a mess.

Effective as an echo chamber for non-dissenting discourse. Not effective for honest conversations about important topics.Love the app!Best apps like Twitter...I don't know what is this but I like this appThe app is fantasticI just get a black screen.Awesome then Twitter...Good Job 👍wont let me post videos :(Can't even post anything on this app I done know whyGood i really liked it 🦋It's pretty cool actuallySuperb app..Better than facebook and ista tbh...Wonder I think its better than TwitterI wish you could switch accounts easily.Only for pm imran khan installed app 😎Better than twitter i guessI don't see a point of this appThis thing is addictingGood app but copy of twitterThis app so slow 😔Better than Twitter for sureThis app is good.Absolutely, awsm app.This app is very goodThe best app i like itGreat job MetaSomething slowly appsI don't have Instagram accountSomething new always appreciatedIt has ultra bugsNow This app is varry amazingeverything glitches when i scroll lmaoNew and the best app..Let's try it and see what it offers. I'm amongst the 1st usersThanks for threads an InstagramIt's an absolute copy of Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg needs to bring something new, always copying an already existing application and releasing as your own. Develop something new which you can say with pride that it is what is made by myself. Copying Twitter won't help.Super app loved itUseless social media app. Fully similar look like 50% Twitter and 50% Instragram. And I have both of app. So why I use this app. Totally boring application. I can't spend my time on this app. So finally I uninstalled this boring app.😵‍💫👎🖕Way better than Twitter.I like it but it does need some improvements like more private settings like there should be a option to hide my replies from people while having my profile in public simliar to the twitter circle like thatJust do it in right way!I'm starting to love this app already 🩵This app is very good, it is a lot of fun, very good appNew thread It was good option for Twitter 😀It a best app for the discussion. And it also promotes the discussion in text , which is quite similar to Twitter but better than it.Combo pack of insta and TwitterMy timeline won't refresh.I can already say Threads will end up being better than Twitter.Never been a twitter fan but now Im into threads🙂This is so much goodIt is super exciting 😃When you search \"elon musk\" results show only parody accounts 10/10Unlike Twitter, you don't have the freedom of speech. I dare anyone to condemn any of their agendas such as: Gender identity or homosexuality and not getting blocked.For me this is okay for me kaya bibigayan ko Siya NG 5 star ratingFull of glitchesAF, wasted my 90 mbs😭The app crashes everytime when I'm going to upload the photo. So I can't post a photo.Very bad app.........Not better than twitter! 🗿The app was okay for the first couple of days and then all my verified accounts and political nonsense. Not even two days and it's turned into Twitter pre 2022.So since this app came out insta shut down and crashes - if it crashes on startup = app doesn't exist = can't have a good ratingNice home page experienceZee fashion trendzz (follow)This app was copied from TwitterIt's better than TwitterIt's wonderful I like this 😍Very Good.

The design is minimilistic but the app is not handy.I Used This App MY Experience is Too GoodAfter I downloaded this app, my instagram kept crashing the moment I opened it. After I deleted this app, instagram started working normally....The app invades users' privacy by abusing the public's lack of attention. I would like to delete my threads account but for that I need to delete the Instagram account, forcing users to continue using that app. This is completely ridiculous, you could have done better.I love this app and vary ujfool ❤❤❤Very bad experience. Needs instagram account to use it and if you create an instagram account with email, their dumb system will suspend it as boat.I don't want instagram.You guys forgot to add # hashtag featurevery good apppppppppEasy to useI am pleased to inform my progressive colleagues that there IS no hiding from the truthTwitter is more better than TreadsWhy I need an insta ac for using it?Just because I can't delete it 🤣After installing this app I can't change my Instagram chat themes I can't call anyone I can't see photos This is a wrost application don't waste ur net and time 🤬Very good apps ❤️❤️There was a bug that made the app unusable, I've submitted a report and hope it gets fixed.Boring.

My Instagram still has the threads badge on my bio. No matter how many times I press \"remove badge\" to temporarily remove it, the moment I refresh my insta page the badge is back on my bio. Meta is using my bio to advertise this app. I have expressed I hate it by uninstalling it and deleting my account it's disingenuous. Shouldn't my data be deleted? Why is there a badgeCtrl + c Ctrl + v 😅Extremely invasive. Collects way too much data for it to be even legal. Moreover, feels like a watered down dumbed out twitterI can't find Instagram bottomA good app of instagramThreads will eleminate the influence of Twitter sonner than laterInclude Message featuresLot better than twitterBetter than twitter!Laughing at all you dumb clowns who are actually downloading and using this🤣🤣🤣.Great app so far✨❤️I found a error occurred in download the app, it was downloaded till 97% then it is not continues.

You have 1000s of followers and get 5 likes. What a waste of time this app is.

The display in this phone is asymmetricalLet's hope it's better then TwitterThis is useful apps 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹Wow😳 Fantastic app ⭐⭐🌟⭐⭐It’s Twitter, but instead of being run by Elon Musk, it’s run by Facebook. The main feed is all people I don't know or follow, “influencers” thirsty for #engagement, and #brands trying to be clever or cute. No thanks. No hashtags, terrible search, and Instagram moderation is terrible. Also, you can’t delete your account if you sign in with your Instagram account without also deleting your Instagram account.Great public relations createdNot good but not bad !excellent app....।That's the best appLike dam super cool wit this new appWow its a good appthe meta has changedI love twiter delete for appsGlad it's not Twitter 💜It's very excitingAnything but Twitter!Best app ever!Way to many bugs and lagging slow speed and feel like total ripoff.Very nice appWorst app please don't useTheards is better to TwitterI don't like reading 🖤Good not too much Good...Crashing so muchSooo good than the tweeter✨✨✨✨✨🥹✨🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹👍🏻🔥It's So much good AppWe need message optionNot worth it just like Twitter or RedditI was told by,7of my 9 daughters to give it a try!!.I am first one in my group who knows about this app and use it.Copy paste (someone idea).wow this app is amazing ♥️♥️♥️♥️Why does it take eternity to just download the App?

Thank you!Does not work. Doesn't load profiles or anything. Gives me an error message. It's been like this for a week.Lags too much.Sleek and Easy...Just make the timeline chronologicalworst social media app everIt's Really useless👀Nice app God bless youWhy no post edit option??Does this look bad VisuallyA twitter alternative for intolerant leftists who can't cope with conservative opinions and want them censored.If you will login once in threads, you can't delete your threads profile ever. If you want to delete your threads profile, your Instagram profile will also delete. You can only deactivate the threads account. So think before download.So far it's great!Just another app from a company run by and used by racists, pedophiles, and degenerate sub-human communists.I loves this appFix this app, tyWaste of time , because of this app , I can't open my Instagram account it's showing that account is crashed 😭no rate limit 👍Good I like this appWay better than TwitterI think thread is completely broke the recordCopy Paste of Twitter literally, exact same features. Even got a share tweet button.Ye aur bhi zyada better hota agar ismai block jinko kisi ne kiya hai and vo unko dekhna chaate hai toh isse aap unn sabko unblock rakhte taaki hum dekh paaye ki they blocked us and if they blocked so you have to ask a question if the answer is valid so you can block them but if they give a fake statement like they are sending a nudes so you have to clearify and then report the I'dApp kinda look half baked,Already better than Twitters toxic cesspool.Very bad #copiedfromtwitterTimeline scrolling is not as good as twitter. It should be like going upwards. I quitted.No way to stop it showing me completely random posts by people I do not follow. So much so that I cannot see posts from those that I do follow.Its a worst app ever when i started using for the first time the screen is full of white lines..My one gripe with this app is that you have to have an Instagram to enter it, I think you should fix that Incase someone has no Instagram.Well it's a good app I've enjoyed it so far but it be even better if it has a night mode and so other features tooThis app has so much glitch. I can't even see a single post clearly . It's so annoyingThe newsfeed so random, i follow my friend, my friend follow some people then its on my timeline/newsfeed, like huh not even in my interest even not im following them, worse social app i ever downloaded.Doesn't work. Showing something went wrong in every screen, complete wasteCool but idk if this is relating to my issuse but ever since i got this my insta acct that's linked to it keeps crashing??? Themes wont work??Trillion dollar company makes app that lacks basic features and will delete your Instagram account if you decide you no longer want their Twitter clone.Twitter copy, the app isn't even good, no dms , no hashtags, no trending topics tab. It is made just to promote cancel culture.First version with too much MBs. I think next time this app gonna have GBs. 😆 I joke! But i like this app, it's good. Congrats to our Boss Maki.After opening this app... My all Instagram chat disappointed. It's loading and loading... Plz fix the problemsI dont like it when it connects with my others account and now i can't delete it. Its so annoying . And dont put it on the Instagram bio . Who give you permission to not delete our Instagram acc ?.why?why? what's the point of a text based platform?when you are allowing the user to use it just like instgramTwitter is so much better, why do we need more app while we can just be loyal to Twitter, it's just a copy from Twitter nothing specialThreads #1 Best app so far user interface and so on. It's just so greater than usual.Please fix Instagram bugs then we will Use threads i have reported many times nearly 25 to 30 times there is bug fixed in my instagram iam boared to use it in that ur saying to use threads lol fix Instagram bugs pleaseIt's a cheap copy of TWITTER. Most of the content here is of Instagram only.It's amazing to have a combination of Twitter and Instagram in one app. IncredibleHad downloaded it to give a try,but it requires Instragram account,so I uninstalled the app instantly,I am not interested in Instagram at allIdk why I rate this 5 ,.... Even I don't use this app but they were just showing rate the rate it's was annoying so rate them ..Timeline becomes blurry when scrolling up and down the interface.It tells me to delete other apps, yet I have plenty of room on my phone. So, I guess I can't download it. I was looking forward to it.Can't log in. It says it's sending a login request, but it never does.Blatant copy of a much better app with less dystopian censorship, Twitter The triple 6 in the logo is the cherry on top. They don't even hide it anymore.This app is perfect but please add the feature where you can find your old posts using keywords.App has destroyed my battery life since installing, Samsung galaxy s22 ultra. Removed app, battery life is back to normal..Log in via Instagram only? But it's for adults, business Entrepreneurs... I don't have and won't have Instagram, I don't have time for thatJust a copy of Twitter with more censorship, more brainless users, Meta is algorithm, annoying bugs, more stubid content Why would someone like it.The app was very good,the app also not very laggy but The problem is the Interface make me felling dizzyWhile scrolling text blinking and distorted, no way back to normal untill restartWhenever i log into threads my insta shows a notification that an unknown device has logged into my insta far from my locationNumerous frame drops...crashes frequently..and most of the time it responds wierdly on my device 🥲I love this app but the fact is that it can't message u only repost or rethread to interact 😭😭🥱 let there be message box like InstagramI just know that for threads to work properly it will take a couple of years. Cause it took twitter a long time. And also if you delete the app it deletes your instagram accountKinda look like Twitter or maybe i'm wrong, and Threads has no advertisment so i think it's great anyway.Facing a glitch whenever I open the app... everything is kind of overlapped and nothing is visible clearIt keeps repainting it self on every action I perform to a point when nothing is visible anymoreIt breaks my Instagram. It shuts down Instagram as soon as i open it.it's very amazing absolutely very amazing. i like it. eassy and beautiful towards the Instagram. Thank you so much threads.I downloaded it 5-6 hours after release and it was crashing and a lot of glitches were thereWastage of time & space on the device. Life is simple. Dont complicate.The app lags on my phone and puts all posts on top of each other so the text is unreadableCan't beat insta though!! Will require new features others than just posting tweets!! Nothing new!! Highly DissatisfiedIts all good.. But why don't you add an AI that common to all the platform like one AI common in all social media fb insta and what's appLol. Mark talking about privacy. Seriously? And people are using it? I mean everyone is thinking it's free so what is the problem? When your all data being displayed in dark web and one day you got a message about a unknown transaction, then you will understand.Very confusing user interface. Looks like the cheap copy of Twitter.Isn't working properly. Too much lag and not working properly.Needs improvement on thread follow feature, as currently the following feature has no use if I can still see on my feed posts from accounts I don't follow.This app without dark mode is just very irritating 😫 Bring it on man or are just busy practicing for the cage fight 😐Too many glitches and blocks you from likes and follows for adding people from Facebook and IG bc it thinks you're a spam acc if u happen to have too many friends.... also doesn't show any people you really follow just celebrities and politicians 🙄90% of my home feed is ads or blue-check-marks posting trash I don't want to see or people I don't care about. For some reason, the other 10% is Spanish and I don't even speak Spanish!!?? I scrolled through today for 10 minutes and didn't see a SINGLE ACCOUNT I FOLLOWED.This is not running in my mobile. This app also glitching, every time I scroll.It was quite good. I really love the app, it helps me gain audience to my Instagram alsoThere is no way to limit all the trash coming into the feed. Rubbish. Twitter may be a cesspool but atleadt you can limit it.After downloading threads I'm facing a glitch in it.. The words, photos all are mixing in one anotherPhoto / videos are not getting uploaded needs to fix 1st dint except these critical error from meta.Nice experience , needs more features but it is on the right track ❤️The app was using about 99% of my battery. Deleted it and my battery was working normal.why do you need all that data to collect like \"Health and Fitness\" and \"Financial info?\" Also why is deleting the account also deletes your Instagram?It's good but no way to chat with someone, it will be boring here if you cannot make someone a friend on this app.Sounded great until I read about the required permissions. Mastodon it is.I think this is beatifull,When they restrict to upload photos so, it can be the Conversational Application.I give it 1 star because the logo is weird(666) and when notifications pop up at the top of the screen you'll see 666 pay attention, 4 days was enough for me to quit...EVIL APP😡Don't like the fact that I'm having to Uninstall and reinstall the app because of the \"try again something went wrong\"Bait and switch. Forced to download & set up Instagram. Sign up ad nauseum.Totally a Useless App. A copy of Twitter with no convenice. Twitter was and always the best choiceTerrible. Downloaded the app and signed up on Instagram but the app never worked......Not too different from insta, I'd stick to insta then. And it's not even that interestingIt just feels like a waste of time ... Twitter is far better ... The UI is so plain...Its not working while using on the tablets fix it please.Though it's working fine on mobile phonesThe app can't even install on my device 😟 Seems everyone will be enjoying the new app and I won't I have a question tho I tried registering ftom Google but I couldn't see any option prompting me to RegisterTotal full to copy of Twitter and I know this will fail soon and you will have to close this application for ever sooner than later.I can't say it's a polished app, yet my experience was good however I'm unable to see the threads posted by the people I'm following on my home page so yeah 3stars that's itIt would've been fun if it didn't crash everytime I try to post a pictureFinally something good from Meta! Please at least don't ruin this app adding so many features and making it way heavier !Barely even an app, plus the company's other products continue to be broken without any customers support whatsoever.A blend of twitter & insta, but somehow worse than both of them 🤷🏽‍♂️ Maybe they'll improve features 🤞🏼Its good app but you need to separate with Instagram means sign up should be there for registration of new accountI used the application for a day until I noticed the amount of data collected, why do they need my financial data or my religious views? This app is complete invasion of privacy.a little bit buggy when you post high res images. it crashes my appCouldn't able to open the app, whenever I try to open it gets crashedExcellent app but there is a problem app UI isn't good ui need to be more clean.Twitter is better zuck. this should be completely another app, not to be linked with insta.chip twitter copy. high quality videos are not at all for technical users.Requires an Instagram account. My account is frozen for no good reason and I cannot recover it.this app is glitching everytime i scroll, the threads and other options get doubled and keep on multiplying as i scrollSo far I'm enjoying it, I think the app is great 😊 Hoping to see more upgrade in the future.Worst app, don't have data saver option, consuming the data like motherfnk hell, why don't this fnk application have data saver option?Worst privacy policy! What's the purpose of this app? Not at all the alternative of Twitter! So much additions needed if this app want to become a rival of Twitter!Not able to see anything ,it's like scrolling itself fastly, blurred imageLove it! I'm tired of all that complicated stuff and this kind of platform is exactly what I need.I still have some issue with itThe UI interface is utterly broken. Unusable.Just needs the ability for private messaging and being able to use gifs in posts.I deactivated Threads. Everytime when I try to hide the badge in my bio, it always shows up again. FIX THIS!!!It quite terrible in my opinion...it missed so much details that tweeter has, as it they made it just for clout.Terrible Rip off of Twitter by Mark, and honestly, it isn't great, so flop on his end .Glitch on the screen, making it uncomfortable to see, prevent the user to use the appI think I love this app coz people have been talking about it on Facebook and Instagram but I've not tested it but I'm downloading it right now but I feel this application is great 👍It's so boring, pretty much it is just a comments section out of instagram. And deleting threads account will delete instagram, and on top it collects and track all user details.Not gonna bet on it as in the near future it will be bloated with instagram esque features.Overall gives good experience and feels like Instagram nothing special about this app but gives you a feeling of newnessit was fun until it doesn't, there is no point in seen strangers I don't care publishing textI'm using a samsung device and the app keeps crashing when I open my profile for some reasonToo cluttered. My homepage is full of replies and posts from accounts I have no interest in.Haven't experienced it but people are downloading it fast and that's a good signVery bad app don't download the aap my reason I create/login account then my account not open on in Instagram and now I deleted both app 😠😠They are collecting all of your data, and recording through your cameras then selling it to the highest bidderplease fix something that causes the app to crash when I scroll on a certain thread. :')For an initial launch it's working really well. Can't wait for federation support to be readyThis is a cheap imitation of another popular app known as twitter. The interface is average.While writing a reply on post input field goes back behind the keyboard, kindly fix this bug.I'm fan of Meta, Special for Mark. Really Amezing. App is very good. Easy to use better than to Twitter. Thanks Meta and Good Bye Twitter.👋👋It's basically a wannabe Twitter with Instagram integration. Unimpressed, uninstalled.When we install it and login our id it works but after it screen doesn't work properlyWhy does this require me to link an existing Instagram account? Why not allow me to create an account in the app instead of downloading another app just to do that.Extreme garbage file compression. No substitute for Twitter.Working like a bug , just after logged in the screen starts flickeringWanted to use for my photography bussiness can't post any photos. Fails everytimeWhen the app is loding all pages are overlapping en each other I don't know why. Sould you fix itIt's been glitching so much. I haven't tried the app without any glitchingWorst, need alots of changes, it seems like a 3rd class copy.Sucks that you have to have Instagram to sign up for this app. Didn't have Twitter but was gonna check this one out.Just a dumber version of twitter. Can't be even called twitter lite. And just like all Facebook apps, it's censorship pron and also say goodbye to your privacy.I don't use Instagram, I quit it but I wanna try threads and it's not allowing without insta account.It is a good app but a little disappointed because if you wanna delete your threads account you need to delete your Instagram account as well which is not fair. I think you need to solve thisIt's amazing, fun and better. Tho how do u get back in when someone found a way to log u outThis type many apps in playstore and google please create social media tracking apps so that can help people this type doesnt help to anyThis app acts like old school bus because this app is no tested well please fix this screen mirroring BugI can't use this app an redmi note 5 pro.many bugs appear and screen blinking.It looks like Twitter but I don't understand why you have to have an Instagram account to be able to use what is supposed to be related to Twitter.Boring and time wasting app a lot of time and energy waste that's way i hate it a lot 👎The extremely annoying fact that you see tons and tons of random accounts you don't follow had me delete this app in 5 minutesIt's good app But it should have some features like when i post any thread it have option like 1. Post to public 2. Post to public + friends 3 post private. Then definitely thread app will overcome Twitter 👍🏻It keeps randomly shutting down when I try to write long posts or upload a videoIt is easy and accessible. Highly recommend downloading!!!This app is the worst app in this category. You are better of using Twitter. Don't install and waste your time. Literal Twitter clone but somehow worse offThis is already good enough. Please don't make it much commercial and tough to use.Great app really good but still needs some more features to be added going forwardSuch buggy piece of trash. Doesn't even opening upon clicking.Shouldn't have Instagram as Login, plus a Bad Copy of Twitter. Don't need another App from Facebookit would be great if threads have following sections so the timeline wouldn't messed upGlitch screen dragging content. UI is not good.App crashes if you attempt to @ someone & you start typing before the suggested accounts finish loading Huawei p30 pro, Android V10I just opened an account in threads later I want to delete because I just want to see but I now I don't need but it's not getting deleted or deactivated. I don't need any account on this but it didn't deleted my account which is very worst part.Disgusting apps now Instagram has made their level down very boring application lots of advertising bugs recommended everyone to uninstall 🤧😏This should have been a personal app, I don't use Instagram but I want to use threads....but as I can see after installation I can't....My application is bugging ,i don't know why Everytime i Scrolls down it get stuck like there is a graphic problem\"Thank you for developing such a remarkable mobile app. It has become an integral part of my daily routine.\"Very similar to Instagram and Facebook can't beat twitter I think who will download the app is the same of people who have Instagram and Facebook onlyVery bad . Recently meta deactivate and restrict my Instagram account. MC Zuckerberg. I don't any social media like this bakwas privacy policy.This app is the worst version of Twitter, the only thing Lark Lukerberg knows is copy paste from other apps. Twitter is way ahead of this mid app.When I scroll down it has Glitches. I downloaded 3 times and same story.Didn't install in my mobile .. Samsung A30 Android 11 .. Google play keeps telling \"pending .. waiting for Wi-Fi\" what's wrong?Since Downloading the app I am unable to open my Instagram anymore it keeps crashingThe app scrolls slowly and it does not work properly in dark modeThis app is not working...when I start it...it shows the display glitchThis app needs a feed for ONLY the accounts a user follows. Otherwise, the feed is just a garbage dump.If I wanted to be on a subpar app where disinfo was not being flagged and allowed to run rampant, I'd just stay on twitter.Twitter Rival! Great App. Everyone come let's share the experience together @richthrillThe app is facing lack and the home page is having too much glitch.....Could not understand why I follow people. I was able to see many other peoples mesaages in my timeline as wellThis app is so messy😩 it's glitching so bad😩 I created my account today but the app is glitching so I can't use it😩It's regularly crashing down whenever you open it.Imitation is the best form of flattery? Coming out with something that's already been done is very 2023, Metaverse. Uninstalled. I'll stick with my freedom of speech on other platforms.It's not that good. Can see all the verified accounts. I don't even follow them. What's exactly the use of this app?So amazing app like Instagram ❤️ superrrr This app can use all no problem, no any excuse.This is a good app provide with fast information and have many more features then Twitter I am using Twitter for many years but it does not give any social media vibesWARNING... if you want to delete your account, you lose your Instagram account too... They require access to ALL your private info... and if you get suspended for any reason you are locked out of Instagram too. Stay Away.Log in correctly with email and password, but it is saying password not correctBest Experience Ever, i love everything simple to use.. Thanks Threads for making an amazing app!The data collection is insane. Why would a twitter wannabe want my financial info, or my health info? Jesus, tone it down a bit, zuck.I did not find any interesting things inside thread no # hastag trending #nocurrent news it's all about not competition it has to be about best out of others as wellSome videos don't have sound despite the mute button being available.I have a problem with the application, the words stick together and everything sticks together. I want a solutionThis new app is good but there is a lot of mistakes need to fix it and add hashtagsYes I using this for last three years nice experience this app has a good interfaceNever seen a app overlapping its function.the screen goes blurry.cant even scroll.Too many bugs, also platform is highly monitored and many posts are censored. Won't recommend downloadingReally poor experience. It also requires an Instagram account.No feed settings, made for an absolutely terrible experience.copy of twitter. if you install it_no way to delite it_ (if you want to delete it, u will have to delete your Instagram account.The interface is pretty cool but I hope there will be more better updates.It's ok. Not something I need at the moment. You follow the same people as you do on insta and you share the same content so what's the point.i can't even download the app, keep taking my data, downloads still 100 but never installs so terribleIt's too good 👍🏼 and it's also work as Twitter some functions as like as Twitter......Very bad app. Instagram is good but Threads won't be like Twitter.This app very bad Because I had just created the account, at the same time it got banned for 180 days. very useful Bad app👎Hope 'Threads' will reach its milestone in short, and users will attract by its attractive features.I dont like that i cant create an account without having an instagram account and i cant delete my account without it affect my insta. There is no way to search for threads, no trending, my feed is full of people i dont know.What?! Again videos? Should be only for text and photos!It's Not Installing On My Itel Vision 1 Pro. Please Fix The Issue As Soon As Possible. Thank You!Everyone just downloaded this app. Anyone here look at app permission. It's access too many thingsGreat idea good app needs a few updates randomly closes over good update and fix is a straight 5 igAbsolutely a very gud app coz many of their acc got hacked so it can help easily to find hackersThe app is good overall unless its a mixture of insta and twitter.Too bad everything is doubled and interface is not changingA boring rip off of twitter. Allowing constant false information and bots to swarm the app.This app is slow. Like very slow. Twitter is much faster than thisNot very good right now. Feels too close to my face if that make sense, in my personal space. Nobody to follow yet that i don't already follow other places.It's good but u can't save photos here, i think this could be added in the other postsfor me it is a zero because the application should have given the possibility to delete without giving up your account on instagramI have not been able to download the application.it stopped when it reached 99%.Hi meta Threads is a great app.I love ur app. And I want to tell that always keep update ur app so you can beat twitter. ThanksVery useful for people and it is very helpful for all. Better than twiterI couldn't sign up. The only option is to directly link it to your IG, instead of allowing you to create a new account. I don't really want my IG and Threads to be linked. Think I'll stick with Twitter for the time being.an extremely bland rip-off of twitter. there's a lacking of something but i can't quite pinpoint what it isAfter installation, everything becomes checkered and the image is distorted😑😑 xiaomi mi note 3 android 8.1Full of bugs, not worth trying to get in touch with meta supportGreat so far, am trying to figure out how it works. how can I change my background to dark mode?Worst copy ever! Pls stop copying other apps. Earth and it's people do not need another Twitter app.Ever since I downloaded this app, my main Instagram account that is linked to Threads doesn't want to work.The app is stopping..if I try to post a picture...it will say threads keeps stopping 😞You have to open an Instagram account to access this. Why it isn't open to Meta users who already use Facebook and WhatsApp is beyond me. Surely one Meta log in would be sensible?A perfect app to waste time. Instagram is better.Completely useless without a feed to see only those you follow.Really great app almost like Twitter but it's good.hope some new features occure.Too many unwanted threads from unfollowed accounts appearing. Unfortunately, it's uncontrollable since there's no setting that disallows these unwanted threadsThis apps useless and has broke instagram (causing crashes), stick to what youre good atDecent, but drains battery and just has less features than Twitterlagging issues and multiple screens opens up at same timeThis app is not good at all. Lacks basic features.The app's color layout is looking like a broken glitchy computer monitor... What's going on? 😣This app is not safe, it's literally letting me see people's phone numbers!!! You're being exposed!!!!Easy interface look interesting.... full review after few days use 👋Good app, but no hashtags, no videos reels, nothing. And also IDK Why my account broken why I opened my Instagram account from threads :)Couldn't create an account as I don't use Instagram, bizarre!!everytime I log into threads i log out from instagram and when I login again to Instagram it logs out from threads.. and it's a cycle.., Threads was the top free app on Apple's App Store and a top ... But it's not quite so easy to leave Threads. Threads is a social media good app.It's glitching everytime I open the app I hope it's fixed soon!Bugs ,bugs, cannot login when you change instagram passwordFacing a massive glitch in this app. Sorry but this is the worst experience I have ever faced.May be Zuck should bring innovative ideas rather than copying Snapchat Twitter Tiktok features Plus the app isn't available in App GalleryIt would be perfect if they will add trending feature like tweeterI try post and it says; Fail to Upload. Txt or pics, i cant do anything.I like this app but it's need a translate for some of the people who write other languages.If post button is pressed multiple times it is posted multiple time. Text field should be cleared after first postInsta+Twitter best comboIts good against Twittergood app for nowBetter if no place for leftists.Nice app superThe app not working properly When I open the app its start glitching so I uninstalled this appThis is the best Instagram it works only for iPhone if you don't have and iPhone don't download @Tasha4xx dm me on telegram for informationEarly launched app Get crash all the time Can't delete account if once made WorstNeed some improvementFinally family settled down with their new kid. #allfrommetaVery Good appThreads app better then twitter 🫣For copying Twitter!!Please add spaces like TwitterSO MANY GLITCHES BRO, MY PHONE SCREEN JUST ERRORS LMAOtwitter still betterNo views on videos reels bakwas algorithmTHIS APP IS BEST ❤️❤️❤️ USE FULLIt's Bangladesh not supported?Lacks real substance compared to the app it's imitating to be. You have to be a self loathing troglodyte to want anything to do with this.Post Edit option should be enable🥺Why can you not create an account??Can't even download it. Keeps saying not connected.

Even if it's new and still needs some fine-tuning, but at least we've got something to finally compete with Twitter which the bipolar oppressor that calls himself Elon Musk has succeeded in destroying since he acquired it. With the rise of other decentralized social media on the fold, this is just the beginning of the fall of twitter.Meta never disappoints!Threads introduced by Instagram is an advanced version of Twitter...I love the concept but need to stabilize your app via day to day updates. ..All the best @Threads🥰🥰🥰 (First Guy to write a review about Threads🥰🥰🥰)Twitter is way betterIt is a good app that fulfilled more than the minimum requirement for a social app. Congrats to MetaEveryone be like threads achieved 1 million user 1:30 hours and here I am out of millions people writing the first review of the app 😂Boring and silly 🙄Improve the bug like glitches in screeen after opening it.After login,it having glitch can't even use the app anymoreGreat very beautifullBekar app without any logic create krdiya haiHonestly, this app is just a copy of Twitter and Tumblr.

This app is like an github clone project of Twitter. Feels polished but no engagement, no new stuff and only followed content is promoted. Learn from twitter and be better if you want a piece of this cake.Twitter ui is betterVery nice! However definitely needs a media tabThis is one of the another greatest work of Instagram team 👀🤩.

Then people want to delete their threads account but you can't. If you want to delete it you have to delete your instagram account and it's stressful.Could be the new Twitter killer. Lets wait and see. Rn, the app is barebones.Need material u icon100% copied from twitter 😆Very nice application ❤️Lagy scrolling that ununderstandable, because it's not happening to anyone elseTexts and images are overlapping.Didn't know you had to have an Instagram account so I made one, then it locked my account out because it wanted my phone number. I shouldn't have to put my number to have an account so my account is locked because of it.So many bugs, really bad algorithm for home pageLeft Wing and heavy censorship...Trash community!I do not like how it connects with your Instagram that's basically scammingBest of first time for Idea wahhReminder: i should not install this appJUST DOWNLOADED IT FOR ROSÉ STREAM ON THE GROUND!They made Twitter for Instagram usersmy threads got suspended for no reason and suspended my insta too :<It keeps crashing whenever I attach pictures.Best replacement of twitter 😁Very very good 👌Wrost app copy of Twitterwith adding some features, this app will be the peak of social media appsIsn't the moon lovely🌚Straight up copy of Twitter.

After enabling the Myanmar genocide, you'd think they wouldn't let it happen again, instead they're keeping up accounts dedicated to harassing trans people with literal slurs in their name. Twitter caved to Nazis, and so does Meta.This app is good but never experienced bcz threads screen bern overlapped every time pls sove it..Quite honestly ... what makes me sour ... is that I can't delete the app, I have to delete my whole Instagram account. And why do you need ALL my personal information made available to you?I wants to know that if we delete Thread our Instagram account will also be deleted ?Sorry meta but you are doing wrong,to download you app you are playing with people Instagram I'd ,so please do not do that it's a humble request.

Literally everything you hate about Instagram is distilled down into something even more annoying. This is a content graveyard. It is where posts go to die. I even offered to give away $1000 if I could get to 50 followers in 3 days, and got ZERO engagement. Don't waste your time with this garbage. At least on Twitter, it feels like you're talking to somebody... Twitter is bad because of the people. Threads is bad because it's a bad platform.Liked it, hope it evolve faster than any Meta services and appsMuch better than TwitterIt ok just like TwitterMy account was in the first 10000 registersThe go to place to interact with advertisements and brandsWorst experience, my Instagram account logouts automatically as soon as I login to threadsYou have to delete your insta account to get rid of it. Dumbest thing I've ever heard of. I don't use Twitter and I don't want to use this.It works now in the case of playing it plays in the case of stopped videoInstalled Because I Like TopG Tate❣️It's such a amazing app 😍It so cool to spend time in it with posting and sharing its so coollooks good till now 👀✨But just got stuck with a Problem. I have a public and a pvt account on Instagram. At first, I logged in on Threads using my pvt account. But now, when I wanted to activate my public acc on Threads at the same time, it asked me to go with any one profile only. Thus, I selected the public acc, and deactivated the pvt profile. But when I look at the pvt acc on Instagram, it still shows the Threads link, which is already deactivated. But the link of Threads on ig of my pvt acc doesn't get clearedExperience is actually niceNothing to explore 😂Dard theme featured please DM convention featured please updateGood Try .. keep it up 👍🔥Overrated,no new features and missing old ones twitter has,not safeGood and worst appNot better than Twitterblatant copy of Twitter applicationIts looks cool...Good job zuuuuukThis is expensive app 🥰❤️‍🔥First review; we need you to add Voice calls and Video shorts like youtube and Tiktok. Let me know when Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg will fight 😂Boring. Twitter, a similar platform, is better.It looks like Twitter.I guess Elon's right...it sucks...I have to delete my whole IG acc if I want to delete threads profile...I'll give you a five star cuz your first coming in beat twitter.I am try to know how it works someone please explainI installed this app, I thought that we can chat in this too like Instagram, but I could not find any chat option. There should be chat in this aap, I think you will get a difference from my review.Helpful apps Please grow my accountbetter than twitterTwitter, but Instagram.App recommends irrelevant content , i wish recommendations from Instagram could transfer to threadsI'm here to see Elon Musk's rating on this app. 😆Please add theme option.So much bugsGood but not goodgood app like TwitterCan't save pics?

Like a wishapp version of Twitter.Is the best aappDon't really know about the app... Cause it's not working on MI Note 5 proTwitter becomes Thread and Thread becomes Neo-Twitter for us.This app version code 😦Sorry but after installation and reading the terms... i thought that i am totally against centralization. I prefer #NOSTR a decentralized protocol for social media. RIP meta....Exlent amzing zing zingwanna try this out but i dont want to create instagram account, turned out i cant. uninstalledLove the app ✨Twitter is The Best ✔️Absolutely terrible, crashes constantly the app just isn't Twitter with free speech !

Not like Instagram.I don't even want to give one star After downloading threads my account is been hacked So never download this app The worst experience of this app 🙏🙏 i could not even find my account 😔 lwra appAmazing app loved it would have given it 6 star's if it was possibleVery bad app experience, cheap copy of TwitterIt's alright but it's honestly Instagram version of TwitterNeed more features but still it's goodVery Good Instagram! You Makin Backup For Twitter!Look like is a great application I haven't use it yet but will do it soon.I mean it's no different than any social media app out there. Nothing interesting abt itToo much personal information is being collected.It's the exact same thing as Twitter except it steals more of your infoBadd experience too much adsThis is the new project of mera. It will definitely better then Twitter. And i wish it will have been use for good purpose. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Threads login should be changed , it should be available for non Instagram users....Really loved the functionality of this app. Now I can proudly say threads is far more better than twiter😍I use it in my sister phone cuz she have insta but the bad thing u neet to create an insta account and after u come to threads for that i think i not gonna use it and i think if u can create a new account in this app it will be good and it be better than Twitter btw i still using TwitterI would give a 5 if you'd let me sign-up without requiring us to have Instagram.It's a spying tool. Do not use or download this malware.Why it glitches in my smartphone. Not working properlyOnly Instagram login is available, no thanksthis app is really bad the ui is not user friendly I couldn't understand anythingKinda interesting and reliableNothing special about it. But one thing about this is not good is we can't delete threads account without deleting Ig account. That sucksQuite an app,twiter mixed with instagram quite an awesome ideaI don't see anything special in this app .. its just another way of wasting our timeShort and simpleIt's a best platform to connected world wide users👍If you still have instagram gotta install this just to login using instagram only chat with private friends so don't see much use of any of itI HAVE NOT ISED YET, BUT TAE TOO MUCH SPACE ON YOUR PHONE, IT NEEDS REDUCE THE SIZES, TO MUCH MB FOR FEW ACTIONS, WHY?Unable to create an account as I do not have an Instagram account.The feed and content is do bad ....I don't know why this application doesn't delete my profile. I don't want my profile on this thread. If I delete my account then why does the Instagram account get deleted too.Ok so be aware that if you want to delete your threads profile anytime, u will have to delete your Instagram account. You can only deactivate it or delete your Instagram account if you want to leave threads.Downloaded it and immediately deleted it because I remembered it's owned by Meta. They suck.It's crashing in my android phone.It is a great app... But needs more features.....Something wrong. Not working properlyrestore my account first. how am i even supposed to use the app when y'all have locked me out of my own account for no reason.Shady terms and conditions. Not falling for fine prints now.I have no Instagram at all and can't use it without it, wagNeeds an Instagram account, uninstall!Threads an amezing application ❤️, it works really awesome.An excellent app to waste your time.It's really annoying that if i want to log out from threads that means that my acc on Instagram will log out alsoYou have to be an instagram user to log into this, as i am not i have removed it. Waste of 5 minutes.Gorgeous 😍 app ,It can be better than Twitter.Lol. Don't compare with Twitter. copy- Meta. Tiktok-- insta reels, snapchat -- insta story, Twitter -- threads 🤣🤣🤣😅 Lol zuck 😅I am unable to log in. Instagram password not matchingVery boring a bad and poor copy of Twitter.Poor app it's not for Geopolitical movements so bad as InstagramWhen I open this app there are like glitch every time happens thisBeautiful app, lots of ppl, zero contentA good app I can talk to people just like Instagrambloody apps its disconting dont Download or use this apps because its waste your time.Very nice app I'm enjoying the nice interfaceWhenever I open this app it's glitches I can't able use this appVery poorly tested and buggy appThis app is doing a lot of glitch in my mobile. Please fix it.It's taking away your information! Please stop it. Read about it! Europe has not allowed this app yet.It's lagging and not workingI just installed it, let us try this. This looks amazingI liked this app very much and hope it can be better with new updates.It's cool to use ..... But also needs some more improvement....Worst, It's just Instagram in frontend And twitter in BackendAs everybody knows there isn't any data privacy in meta and this program is so much limitedI'm not able to download this app , and idk why it's happening, please help me out !!Tread is the best text app.Sophos recommends NOT to allow this app's auto features.Super fun but there's no dark mode 😂I'm a twitter user not ig.. no option to login without ig id.. lol can't beat twtrIt's glitching veryyyy much. I can't even use it omygod!!Hope to have great experience with the way it's treading currently.Lot of trackers,no dm option,its like zuck's personal platform for people to create natural language examples that zuck can use for training LLMs for freeVery easy to make in account 😉It's great but have lots of glitchesBad experience in general. It shows everything i don't wanna see. \"Friend's posts? Nah. Check out what this stupid 'influencer' has to say about things they don't know anything about whatsoever\".Requires Instagram to create an account. No thank you.Please make it using without Instagram, I don't have any Instagram account but I really love to use threads 🥲💔This app is fantastic. Is very simple, I really like this app.Nothing new in the app, seems more like insta rather than twitterNot well tested lots of crashesIt keeps crushing anytime I'm attaching a picture to a thread.Nice app..... Add DMs to it and allow me to pin a post ☺️Wasn't able to open the app after downloadWorst app all thing copied from Tweeter Snapchat 😒 not some different so frustratedIt shouldn't be compulsory to have other meta accounts to access Threads . Only then it can beat twitter.Full copied app by Titter. I don't expect this from Meta.Not looks like easy to use𝑻𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒂𝒑𝒑 𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚 𝒄𝒐𝒐𝒍,,𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒂𝒑𝒑 𝒏𝒐 𝒗𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒐𝒔 𝒑𝒍𝒂𝒚 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒓𝒆𝒆𝒍𝒔,Not Bad.Threads need following News Feed and Update profile sectionTerrible and buggy.Lacks all the features except censorshipCan't launch app, I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S8Cool app but videos should be recommended to all viewers on thread appNot signing up to Instagram to be able to use it.Always have something wrong and can not see posts and post anythingMy account just stopped responding and it displayed my original Instagram profiles 💀💔 would u fix that for meThis app is excellent and easy to use. It's really nice and good.Waste app..East or west, Twitter is the best.Can't log in unless I already have an IG account? No option to create a basic IG account upon install? I'm out. Zuck sells all your data. He went to congress about it. He got caught. Not a fan of Musk but this should be a stand alone app. No need for IG. Btw..you can't delete Threads without deleting your IG all together.No SMS verification codes and 24 hr block never endsThis is most wonderful app...its like tiktok.Instagram. Fb..love thisA social media where you cant see the people you FOLLOW on the main timeline is an abysmal idea, this thing doesn't even have a DM function.Omg this app needs so many permissions to run. ScaryThe big failure about this app is that attached with Instagram.We don't need any new freaking app anymore. We need to stay by ourselves.Notsees would love this app controlling speech and what notThis app not properly working in my mobile showing glitch 😭😭So much bug expected to be fixed soonThis app stops the instagram.and there is no solution.Another day... Another social media app. And even made by facebook. The worst company of all timeI don't like it, less features, please updateStopped working for me. The only way to use it is through the app.captures all of personal information.The app is simple and complex This is the future ☺️It is actually not good to me I am not sure if it is because of my phone but it acts weard when I scroll 📜 down 👇 🚮My Instagram stopped working after I downloaded this appIt's pretty easy to navigateAfter loging in my Instagram account my Instagram is not workingThis application is very useful but name is not right.the best platform,🇾🇪Excellent app, it is much better than Twitter!It's buggy+ laggy and also twitter>>>Twitter is better then thread. Don't waste time in thread apps.this app is so bad i can't even use it, it keep glitchingI would rate it a 5 if mark can win the cage fight. Lets go.It's just Twitter without the stuff that makes Twitter coolEnable 'create new id' instead of 'login with instagram'Copy cut off twitter... Audience don't like it because of twitter already this type app in marketWhy we copy, Why we need one more when one is perfectThis is a copy of Twitter but it doesn't feel like Twitter.Unable to delete account without deleting Instagram. Pathetic attempt to get more usersvery difficult UIIf you have the sense of humor of a Hulu ad then this brand managers idea of a social media app is for you. Threads only exists for influencers and brands to talk at each other. You can't curate a feed so your generated on can be full of hate speech like mine was. Golly heck you can't even swear and explicit content is banned. You also need a separate account to sign up and you can't delete this profile without deleting your Instagram. Avoid.Crashes, gltiched app released to early to earn moneyWithout hashtags and trends its just facebook, whats different??? Whats special in threads.. Its basically boringJust like it. Way much better than Twitter, which is irrelevant lately.Copy is copy anyway , original is always bestIf you don't have Instagram account you can't have threads. No way to register w/o Instagram account.Not enough features yet..Two minutes in and done, it's a bubble like the opposite of Truth Social.I feel forced to use it, and can't delete it without deactivating my instagramRuns relatively well but the community is made up of the world's most boring people bent on showing off fake positivity or grifting and that's all the algorithm shows you. incredibly dull experience don't do it if you delete your account you'll be forced to delete your IG tooNo ratting all nudes & adult seen folower dirty sites very bad experience in Instagram and threads pi stop all these nonsense on social media.Literally twitter copy and paste. Pathetic zuck, don't expect anything better from you anyway.Poorly designed UInot increase followers bakwas app..insta bhi use karo yebhi kro..not logical only data waste and time also..Needs Instagram account to log in. I don't have one.Needs more work on the loading interfaceAwesome app Mind blowing Excellent performance 👏👍Cant repost and add comment. And pop out everytime. Please fix this!!!I dont think that this app will be like twitter but it will be really really successful , it can even reach 1 billionI love how I'm able to express myself in Threads. Definitely shaping modern conversation.Sigh... it's boring but it will eventually get better in the future.Never go back option and Instagram combo deleted optionThis app looks like Twitter Clone. Nothing original. (Apart from design)Cool plateform I really impress bost business then this plateform right chooseCan't get threads unless you have an Instagram account! What kind of silliness is that!Thank you for your contribution Sir we are still waiting for free mode on thread an Instagram account.Firstly i love threads and thanks for a change to use this threads app and hope u will be invent more and more app for our social communication and livesCopy and paste from Twitter!!! Present something new, what else is this?!Very clean ui structureVery Good app I have Really Appreciate To use this plat Form Am Happy 😊🎈😘After download it my Instagram always auto exit cnt use anymore lolI LOVE THIS APP! IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER APPS SIMILAR TO IT😉This app so amazing and have full fill all the requirementsworst than twiter And also all our personal information was absorbedIt is laggy with lots of glitchesIt is unbelievable and fantastic app I have ever seen.Pathetic and the most confusing app.Not working for pixel deviceNot uninstallable it's not good to force user to use it 😠It's good but unfortunately not better. Waiting for better update before jump right inIt's good and ok hope it will save us from harsh Twitter rulesNo non-algorithmic timeline. Therefore, no way to see the people I follow. You had literally one job and you biffed itOne more time waste application by meta.Taking too much time to downloadUploading is very slowWhy needs to be linked directly to Instagram ?!!!! Why cant open a new account like twitter or other social applications I dont like itTwitter copy that isn't as good, No thanks !!!Great app.Can be a good competitor for twitter.Horrible could not keep app open.Trash; don't touch it. How can Facebook even call this a Twitter killer when they don't even allow NSFW or Porn on the platform. Why do you think people have flocked to Twitter for years? It's certainly not about politics and news and keeping in touch. Threads will be a Twitter rival as soon as they allow NSFW content just like their competitor.I can't login since I don't have meta account. They should provide other optionsNot even an option to sign up if you don't have Instagram 😂Very boring application, poor rehash of twitterGood UI , EASY to useapp keeps crashing while I'm typing a threadI tried to deactivate my account on threads but the badge on ny Instagram won't go even after removing itYour app is very very good thanks just i want 100k followers oky thanks everyone i am somalia my name is moho17 office threads an instagram app rate this appCopycat of Twitter.

Not for Social, Politics ...Waste of app ...Glitches starts to appear the moment you scrollHorrible app. Cheap copy of twitterIt keeps glitching i can't use it please help meIt is fine but I don't understand why it won't let me login to my IG account.it wants me to download the threads app😐It doesn't want me to download it & I badly want to try it out !!!Dog water. Crashes every time I open.Good but as a new app it needs more and more updates.Dumb app , doesn't has even 10% features of twitterGood and very simple appI'm open app it's shake, i can't roll up and downIts a great app to use but its a bit similar then twitter. I'll rate 5 star for thisTried to open. Will not allow. Maybe try beta testing before launch. JsThe badge keeps coming back on IG profile, even after you select to hide it several times.Wow amazing app it's to easy I just love it ❤️Nice programs have alot of newsIt's trash. Don't want or need that level of big brother moderationQuite basic. I think Twitter is way better.I am getting my screen entirely glitch even I haven't seen a single thread after installing Wt the hell is this forWe have enough text apps already.Not sure what was the need of this app if we already have Instagram and LinkedIn 😬😬Very bad not good features.Forced to use because of Instagram, awful.Since I installed this program, my Instagram page does not load😭😭😭😭😭😭helpppppIt looks like a cheap version of Twitter.This app started crashing after login into my account.It's just an awesome Bombastic app than Twitter ❤️Thread help in growing content??This is very good app and make the insta like professional 🫂One needs an Instagram account - Buuuuuhhhh.Thanks Instagram for making threads, a direct threat to Twitter. Best of luck.Nice App i love it from the first 5 minutesReally good aap I just want a aap which can replace Twitter and look here it isGlitch app not workingThese are the some parts of instagram's features, then why should i use this ?It's just a copy of twitter with alot of restrictions.Good app. I just hope I can change my username without changing the one on my IG accountNo fame very much memes even threads also not been handling the pages my i,d-Yea threads is blowing up very fast an it's the new Twitter practicallyit's like twitter... Threads is useless and is boring.It's the best app and it will take the place of Twitter in coming daysAm so terribly over the moon to be on the history of this app.Meta a company who is collecting data... And will end up selling it and make more .... People now a days believe in hype and don't care about data... Data + AI its gonna track every thing you... Already they do that now its gonna be every thing... Be carefulI don't know what's wrong with it it's frustrating on my phoneIt suck after I installed it less then 1 minutes I removed it.Interdependency on InstagramThe fact that they locked us in without the option of deleting our account is a big NO for me.I was pleasantly surprised by this app, so much better than twatter and mammoth, Zuckerberg is a genius.Standalone app is useless unless you have an Instagram accountJust an excuse for Meta to destroy the Fediverse. Meta created a shadow profile for every Instagram user without their consent to falsify their launch numbers. Delete Threads. Delete Instagram. Delete Meta.This app harmful to phone and Instagram,so Don't installed this app 😠....Not working properlyI don't like it personally it better to on InstagramThey censorship is topnotch, I want to feel free and express myself so I will stick with twitter💯💯Worst app,twitter is better with freedom of speech without cancellationGood Ni hota imp and exp in urdu bolo mujay English Nahi ATI Radeon HD and I am so sorry to hear from you soon plz find the attached file is scanned image in PDF format I am so sorry to hear from you soon plz find the attached file is scanned image in PDF format I am so sorryThis app is far better than Twitter ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ** Writing this down so that mfs from insta don't join twitter **Not a good experience with this app,Twitter better. L ZUCKThis app has some amazing features far more better than twitterMy thread application keeps bugging everytime I opened itI'm sure I'm part of the pioneers of this new Mark Zuckerberg app 😂😂. Everything about this app is excellent 👌.I don't have Instagram.. but I want to have Threads... this is not possible. I can't log in.Two days using that app and it is very good, the only thing is that I close the app and I do not know why but I like itwhen i open the text glitches when i move downBiggest size app. Please reduce size.Copy of Twitter, no privacy at all. An app from... you know.Why is this app being popularized? Isn't it a knock off version of Twitter? What was wrong with Twitter that this app is gonna solve?Unable to create an accountVery easy and good app to useCollects way too much datais there ever going to be a point where you can join this app without having an Instagram?You can do anything but can't compare it with Twitter Uninstalled soon after download 🫡It's a very good app though it still needs a lot of workhen nice but I don't find many people posting useful infoCheap version of Twitter, still in betaIt feels like a duplicate ,u know what I meanThis is super smooth better then expectedThe @Threads an instagram app is so awesome . THANK YOU.Didn't use Twitter much to begin with. not expecting this to change it lolIt's app function is so good And I awesome 👍😎 This app is so beautiful ❤️Quick uninstall. Last thing I need is another Twitter brought to us by Facebook.This app don't work well at all on my phoneThis apps is not good because this apps lazy slow download for this apps 😂Not good, always glitchEveryone try to be funny and meaninglessWhy do we need Instagram credentials to access this? I don't use or have Instagram 😀Great app fast work app I got verifiedcopy cat and not user friendly. original is originalNice app..but i wish have online storeVery trash app twitter is 1000X better get free speech then we can talkthe algorithm sucks. why do i have to read a thread from people i haven't followed?Glitched, can't use it.Nice, I like it and I think it's better than TwitterNot what I was expecting. I only want threads from my followers. No way to eliminate (turn off) all other threads. To much personal data is collected. In my opinion Threads is over rated.Why do I need to see threads of people who I don't follow. It's irritating af. Also too bad that you can't delete threads without deletin instagram.Keeps on crashing.Meta is censuring and stealing our data. I prefer the twitter.Laggy as hell. I don't understand why i should use a app that is worse then twitter AND steals my infoLove it but I can't even reply or post atm pls fix the bugs so I can threadA very good development for InstagramThe application supports Russian fascists. I do not advise anyone. Zuckerberg supports fascism (surprisingly, it's true).This is a garbage like insta, face and more... 😆If I don't have Instagram u can't log in!!Yes, because, the blots on humanity Twitter, Facebook, IG, TIkTok weren't enough. We were clearly in need of another nuisance of a text based social app, from a cancer of company called Meta.It has so many bugs pls fix themY'all made a Twitter with more liberal screeching, very cool.Not good as Twitter it is like copy of that! 🤙🏻I give only one star because app was start blinking when I login in thread 😑😑😑😑😑I'm not interested this app because login type is only one, not other wayReally shameful as it copied a already existed twitter app...Not working properlyGreat start to diversity in social media.Very glitchy UIBest App with Amazing featuresJust Facebook with Twitter UI and with the poor Facebook algorithm which showes you the least intrested posts for youAbsolutely Fabulous App I never seen before.. ❤️Overall its super good but copying is not the answerThis app is really amazing and can take place of twitterHave been trying to download threads since morning but isn't going throughVery bad copy totally from TwitterHeavily lacking featuresNice app For Follwers CommunicationsI like it new features and more than Instagram thanks ❤You can not criticize the app... The level of hypocrisy they are doing in terms of creating a social media app.. if you try to post any post with word \"bug\" or similar it will block you to do.. Better they don't call ita a social media call it restricted media appTwitter but with no free speech and politically correctJust read that after installing it with instagram if you remove threads it removes both, luckily I didnt install this piece of garbageWill not recommend. Its just a cheap version of Twitter.Not working properlyCrash àpp Not working properlyIt's full of glitch.. can't even scrollcopy paste for twitter and after install you can't delete it hate this appIt's Twitter. It's literally just Twitter. If you like Twitter this is fine. If you hate Twitter you'll hate this. Simple as that.Cheap shot!!! Don't install this & give you data to monopoly agendaVery good application for using this easyI like this aap because we work very simpletimepass application can't compete with twitter.THIS APP. SUCK THE SWEAT OFF OF SATIN'S TAINT IF I COULD GIVE IT LESS THAN ONE STAR I WOULD.👎🏻uploading the \"tweet\" or whatever name this is called, is so slow. and who are these people on my feed.The app is super cool and I love its features ❤️❤️🧡Twitter better than threads..

Thanks to meta. I am a big fan of Mark Zuckerberg 🫡🫡. You are my boss.Ku app . I not able find buly searching the ku appToo much errorsWish I didn't have to have an Instagram account to use this. It is what it is I guess...mark wasn't able to buy twitter so he made his own and that's what this app is.Twitter is far better than threads. Zuck is cuck . Zuck made copy of Twitter just removing photos from insta.Very good application for everyoneFix The Buggs That's All 😑😑Best app of our generation I love itChoppy, laggy af on my phone. What happen?Mind blowing and supernatural thanks for giving this masterpiece uhmmm i want followers by the way @mahira._.350Very informative app.Nice Idea and nice work 👍👍👍Twitter is the best.. This is copy app.So many bugs and glitches 😐😐So boring aap and have so many glitchesHype created agnest Twitter. Unfortunately it is not compatible with Twitter. If Twitter is 100% then Threads is 50%.Terrible App.. Forget Any Competition To Twitter..Very boring compared to twittertry hard to be like twitter, and showing up unfollowed user in feed is big no for meThanks, Meta! Needed an alternative badly.Love the interface ❤️Same as Twitter . Twitter is much betterI only want to see who I follow I keep seeing random posts. I dont want thatWay better than that trash twitter.I cant use my Instagram after downloading this please fix this I want my account backMeh. Just another social platform full of try hards.It is better to use threads then paying to TwitterThe app is so amazing Love the ui tooIf you are concerned about privacy & data protection, avoid this app.100% copy of Twitter, bad vibes from lizard boy again! Everything he toch terns into poopNew to this app will tell my feedback later after using it for week , new app yay , I hope this app deserves 5 starIt's a good app. Mark, do more on thisNeed to login with Instagram, which I don't useWorst app...lots lots lots of bugsCollecting a lot of user's data.Not working High lag 😭😭Why can't we login using other accounts, why just Instagram??Issue it fails to install!!App is bugged can't see anythingI love the features, it's a 10/10 for meThankx meta for giving us an amazing app😩💙💙💙💙💙Not installing in Android mobileJust another garbage app from Meta. Stupid name too.One of the wrost platform ever seenIm having trouble uploading the appTrash privacy policy. Overall a cheap Twitter rip offVery good apps im threads iser from.nepal.Nice app just add a trending section you know.Insecure, excessive data collectionNot interested this app 👎 Twitter is best 👍Allow users to dissociate their account from Threads. It's very cunning to only allow users to delete their threads account if they agree to delete their Instagram along.Totally a copy of Twitter...except fully censored and monitored by Big Tech and likely the FBI, DOJ and CIA for pshyop opportunities. Don't waste your time, just use Twitter, another FAIL by Zuckerberg like Meta. Marxists.Found content to be quite boringI think Threads is better than Twitter. Easy to Use.Have to have an Instagram account to log inVery irritating appTook me 5 minutes to check it out and uninstallSave yourself the uninstall and just don't download it.My app is bugging There is problem in my display screenCool features.

We came from Adam and Eve. They were given choice and decided to ignore God's warning. They disobeyed. They were removed from paradise and were fallen. We have the same nature as them when we are born as humans. Unless we are born again. The only way to be born again is to trust in what Jesus did on our behalf, facing God's wrath which we deserved to face even though He lived a sinless life, even to death. Forgiveness of sins is only found in Jesus's name.Black version of Twitter 😂...
